            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For, as except wee know Chriſt, we cannot either put our affiance in him, or obey his word, and ſo obtaine ſaluation by his meanes; ſo, except we know Antichriſt we can neuer beware of him, nor reſiſt him, nor fight against him. Beſides, as it is a notorious iniurie and outrage, to call any one by the name of Antichriſt, or to flye from him, he being not ſo; ſo it is a palpable flattery vnworthy a Christian, to honour, reuerence, and adore as a God on earth, him whom we ought to deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, as the moſt pernitious Organe of the diuell.</p>

Others carried with the current of the inueterate opinion of the authority of the Church of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome, haue not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the truth, but alſo banded themſelues against it, with all their force. Albeit that God notwithſtanding theſe clouds of darkeneſſe, and the furie of Antichrist, which ruined all that durſt open their mouth against him, raiſed vp alwayes certaine holy men, who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their owne liues, gaue glory to God, and diſcouered the impoſtures of this Sonne of Perdition: inſomuch, that ſince diuerſe centuries of yeares, it hath pleaſed the Lord to manifeſt more fully his abhominations, by the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But as this excellent benefite amongst all thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:1279:5"/> wa receiue from God in this decrepite Age of the world, ought to be prized and acknowledged in all reſpects; ſo there are verie few which regard it as they ought Some by their negligence, ſuffering the Empire of Antichrist to be repaired where it was aboliſhed: Others, by their miſerable diſſentions, opening away for this Woolfe, to enter into the Sheepe-fold of Chriſt: And others, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together all their dexteritie and quickeneſſe of fraudes, ſophiſmes, and lies, labouring to vpholde his ſeate from falling. For to this purpoſe ſerue the new wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of thoſe that endeauour to make the world beleeue that Antichrist is not yet come, to the end, to lull men aſleepe vnder his tyranny. And therefore as theſe men employ all their diligence to maintaine the life of this Beaſt, against whom all ought to arme themſelues: So ought the true Seruants of God, ſtiffely to bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues both with voyce and pen againſt him, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their maſter Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is true, that there a ſort of men too politicke and timorous: who otherwiſe being ſound of Religion, yet thinke, that truth may be ſufficiently taught, and error confuted, without making any mention of Antichriſt: a kinde of people which require of vs another manner of diſcretion in the execution of our charges, then was v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed by the Prophets and Apoſtles, and which conſider not how great imbecility is in man, and how eaſie hee is to be tranſported into error, eſpecially then when it cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in vnder the maske and appearance of Holineſſe &amp; Meekeneſſe: and therefore how needfull it is to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the quicke, that hee may bee retained constant in the profeſſion of the truth: and in a word, that regard not what dutie of obedience they owe to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:1279:6"/> of God, made to vs all, <hi>Apoc. 18, 6.</hi> For vvhat a tyrannous part would it bee, to hinder thoſe that know and ſee the Wolfe, from making an outcry againſt him? What a lazineſſe to ſpare him, that ſpareth and careth not for the ruine of ſo many ſoules, which hee holdeth Captiue? Nay, ſo farre it is, that faithfull Teachers ought to hold their peace, that they ought rather vvith full throat to cry out, and vnite their Veines with that which reſounded from heauen; <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye bee not partakers of her ſinnes: for her ſinnes are aſcended vp vnto heauen, and the Lord doth remember her iniquities.</hi> And albeit no man ſhould anſwer to our cry, yet at leaſt wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer our owne ſoules from death, and carry this witnes in our conſciences, that we haue not held the trueth in vniuſt ſilence, to the danger of ſoules, which Chriſt hath bought with the price of his blood.</p>
            <p>This is that which cauſeth this Treatiſe to come forth into publique, that they which yet know not Antichr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, may at length know and deteſt him: and they vvhich both know and detest him, may bee confirmed in their knowledge, and encreaſed in their deteſtation; and ſo hereby may make more account of the benefits of Chriſt, and be more rauiſhed with his loue. For the more wee know and deteſt Antichriſt, the more are we enamored with Chriſt, and long for his comming, and deſire the full reuelation of his glory. So that ſuch as do not w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th all their heart abhominate this Man of ſinne, let them vaunt of themſelues what they will, yet are they farre eſtranged from true piety, and that holy zeale, vvhich made <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay, Pſal. <hi>139.21.22. Lord, ſhould not I hate them that hate thee? and ſhall I not bee
<pb facs="tcp:1279:6"/> offended at them that riſe vp againſt thee? Yes, I hate them with a perfect hatred, as if they were my enemies.</hi> Now if this plaine confeſsion doeth further enrage Antichriſt againſt vs, &amp; it come ſo to paſſe that we muſt ſeale it with our blood, we ſhall be thrice happy: for then, ſhall we be receiued into heauen, there to ſing alowd this bleſſed ſong; <hi>Aleluiah, ſaluation, glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and power be to our Lord God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 19, 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>for his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are true and iuſt, becauſe hee hath taken ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the great Whore, which corrupted the earth with her Fornication, and reuenged the blood of his Seruants from her hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The method which ſhall be obſerued in this Treatiſe for more facility, is this. The firſt part ſhall containe the definition of Antichriſt, drawne out of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The ſecond, ſhall bee an application of this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pope, by certaine proofes. And the third, ſhall refell the opinion of the Romiſh Doctours touching Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>For the rest, I proteſt that my intention is not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend mens perſons: I onely deſire to deſtroy errour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gift of Grace giuen me of God, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the reuealing of the kingdome of Antichriſt, in what perſon ſoeuer I meete withall. And in that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale my name, it is not in apprehenſion of any feared cenſure, which ſhall be alwaies moſt acceptable to me, if it proceede from the Spirit of Charity, which ought to guide the hearts and hands of Chriſtians. But I haue alwayes bene of opinion in this ſubiect, that trueth hath more force, being all bare and naked, then ſhadowed with the names of men. And if after the labour of ſo
<pb facs="tcp:1279:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> many learned men, that here illuſtrated this matter, and whoſe footsteps I haue purpoſely followed, there bee found ſome clearing by this Treatiſe, as I hope will bee to them that ſhall take the paines to reade it through, and eſpecially the third Part; I deſire, that the glorie thereof may bee rendred to GOD alone, who will right ſoone make knowne to the world by the comming of his Sonne, the vtter abolition of him, whom he hath already ſo cleerely diſcouered by the Torch of his Goſpell.</p>

               <p>Now marke that which the Scripture reports in few words concerning him, which I will explaine and proue in euerie part afterwards: to wit, that Antichriſt ſhall bee a certaine man ſtirred vp by the efficacie of Sathan; one in number at one time, but yet varying by ſucceſſion and ſubrogation: who ſhall make profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, though in effect he wholly oppoſeth himſelfe to his Doctrine, ſhall haue his kingdome in the great Citie which reigneth ouer the Kings of the earth: ſhall exerciſe a double power, one ſpirituall, another temporall: ſhall carry himſelfe in the Church of God, as if he were God: working ſignes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but falſe and lying: ſhall be an Idolater, Ambitious, cruell, full of all filthineſſe, reuealed in the laſt times, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſhall be fully deſtroyed by the glorious comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The perſon.</note>1. We ſay, that Antichriſt is a <hi>Man:</hi> conformable to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1279:13"/> that of the Apoſtle, who calleth him <hi>a Man,</hi> 2. Theſſ. 2.3. We adde, that this Man is one in number, at one time, but varying by ſucceſſion; becauſe the Scripture attributeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, things which cannot agree to one onely man. For the Apoſtle telleth vs,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2, 7.</note> that this Myſtery of iniquitie was in working in his time:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 3.</note> to whom accordeth Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> when he ſaith, that <hi>he was euen then in the world.</hi> And yet the ſame Apoſtle ſheweth, that he ſhall continue to the end of the world, and ſhall bee aboliſhed by the preſence of Chriſt; both which cannot be truly ſpoken of any one man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we may adioyne this, that that reuolt whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, and of which Antichriſt ſhall bee the head, is not a worke of one or few yeares. Therefore we conclude, that this Antichriſt ſhall indeede be alwayes one onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in number, reigning ordinarily: but that this perſon ſhall be changed from time to time for the continuation of the order. Euen as in a Monarchy, one onely at one time hath the dominion, who comming to faile, death ſeizeth the liuing (as the ordinary phraſe ſpeakes) and the next heyre taketh his place in the kingdome: or at leaſt, another is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated into the deads roome by a new Election, as in the Empire. But the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Antichriſt, as of one ſole perſon, and not as of many, becauſe all theſe Seducers ſhall haue but one end and ayme, to wit, to reigne at their pleaſure in the Church: ſo they ſhall maintaine their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by one meanes, to wit, by falſe doctrines, and by falſe myracles.</p>

So that if wee make knowne that all that which wee haue reported out of holy Scripture concerning Antichriſt, do properly and ſingularly agree to the Pope of Rome; no man can deny, but that he is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Antichriſt, whoſe communion wee ought with all our heart to deteſt, at leaſt if we deſire to be receyued into the communion of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But when we ſay that the Pope is Antichriſt, and that Rome is his ſeate, we doe not meane that all thoſe that haue bene Biſhops of Rome ſince the Apoſtles times haue bene Antichriſts: we would in no caſe wrong thoſe holie Lights which haue ſhined bright in it in the primitiue Ages, when this Church was ſet forth vnto others, as a rare example of holineſſe and purity, in doctrine, and manners, and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of martyrdome: But this is it wee affirme, that all the Popes of Rome,<note place="margin">About the yeare. 605.</note> ſince the time that Antichriſt hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and begun his kingdome, are this very Antichriſt of whom we haue before diſcourſed: And that Rome is the ſeate of Antichriſt, ſince the time that it began to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints.<note place="margin">About the yeare. 1073.</note> And if any demand when that time was; we anſwer, that it was then when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the third obtained of the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> a murderer of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the title of vniuerſall Biſhop or head of all Churches. But after a ſingular manner, when the Popes to the end to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their ſpirituall tyranny, ſerued their turnes more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with the temporall ſword againſt Kings and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1279:18"/> As aboue all in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, before ſirnamed <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who filled Chriſtendome with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſeditions, ſackings, and turboyles by thoſe bloudie warres, which hee moued againſt the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. For albeit that the myſtery of iniquity begun to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance forward in the Apoſtles time, whereof we haue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table figure in the Harlot <hi>Iezabel</hi> mentioned <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the ſimplicity of the Paſtours of the Church, and of the faithfull and their zeale, to preſerue the Euangelicall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with held (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) this man of ſinne, from ſpewing out his poyſon openly: beſides the puiſſance of the Romane Empire which was then in fulleſt vigour, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him not to lift vp himſelfe in that arrogant power, which hee hath phantaſied to himſelfe ſince that time. But when this ſimplicity Euangelicall began to decline, both in the hearts of the Paſtours, and in the Church in generall: and on the other ſide, the Romane Empire beganne to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the inuaſion of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and other Nations, which coaſted vpon it on euery part; then this ſonne of perdition began by litle and litle to eſtabliſh his power euen in the ſight, and vnder the noſe of the Emperours: In ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, that this was not done without oppoſition and reſiſtance, and particularly in reſpect of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, aſſumed to himſelfe the title of vniuerſall Patriarch, and a primacy ouer all other Churches: which practiſe was afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and ſtifled by the Emperour <hi>Phocas.</hi> But howſoeuer the Popes for this effect and purpoſe often abuſed the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſword, yet they tooke not vp the temporall ſword vntill <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth,<note place="margin">Apolog. of the league, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht <hi>An. 1106.</hi>

But the Pope teacheth, that the Scripture is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ambiguous, a leaden rule, a noſe of waxe, obſcure, the booke of Hereticks, the cauſe of errours: read the Treatiſe of Cardinall <hi>Peron</hi> touching Traditions, or of the vnſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Scripture: and <hi>Bellarmine De verbo Dei;</hi> and <hi>Charron in his three verities,</hi> with others.</p>
               <p>As concerning ſinne, the Scripture teacheth vs that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is a vicious habit, cleauing ſo cloſe to our Nature, that it cannot bee vtterly deſtroyed, no not in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo long as wee liue in this world.

About this time, or litle after, liued the renowned <hi>Italian</hi> Poet <hi>Dante,</hi> who in his 19. Sonnet of Hell, ſaith (ſpeaking of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third) that it was hee, of whom the Euangiliſt S. <hi>Iohn</hi> intendeth to ſpeake, vnder the name of the Whore which ſitteth vpon many waters, with whom the Kings of the earth committed fornication. The ſame Poet in his ſixt Sonnet of Purgatory, maketh this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, That <hi>Rome</hi> had once the ſhining torch of two Suns, which made the moſt ignorant better to vnderſtand, both the things of this world, and of God: But that now the one hath baniſhed the other, the ſword being ioyned to the Paſtorall ſtaffe, ſo that they cannot well goe together, the one not ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in awe of the other. If any beleeue not this (ſaith he) let him iudge the tree by the fruite, and he will confeſſe, that ſince the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> conſounded in her ſelfe the two powers, ſhe is growne to all wickedneſſe, and deſtroyeth with herſelfe the Commonwealth of Chriſtians. About the yeare 1381. <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> borne in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> compoſed a large Volume concerning Antichriſt, wherein he laboureth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1279:29"/> to proue, that he was already in the world, and that the Pope was he: adding amongſt other reaſons this one, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ordinances, men worſhipped the Saints as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours, and their Images and relickes in ſtead of Ieſus Chriſt. A Chanon of the Citty of <hi>Prage</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> called <hi>Militſius,</hi> a Doctor of Theologie, preached in the time of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the eleuenth, that Antichriſt was already in the world, and that he reigned viſibly in the perſon of the Pope, Cardinals, Biſhops, Monkes, and other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, who not teaching the truth, by their ambition and negligence, made the Church deſolate, filling it with temporall riches, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyling it of ſpirituall. Inſomuch, as hauing gained to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe many Auditors and Diſciples, the bruite hereof came to the eares of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated him. About this very time, <hi>Wicleffe</hi> began in <hi>England</hi> to preach the pure doctrine of the Goſpell, againſt the traditions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not ſparing it in his writings any more then the reſt had done. This man was followed by many others, as by name, by <hi>Iohn Pourney</hi> an Engliſhman, who writ a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vpon the Apocalipſe, where he calleth <hi>Rome</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels Brothel-houſe, &amp; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Whore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> Then came <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> after the yeare 1400. who greatly promoted this doctrine, and loſt his life together with <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> for the confeſſion thereof, at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> This was about that time when Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. hauing cauſed the Croyſado to bee publ ſhed for the maintenance of warre intended againſt <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Naples:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aeneas Silvius Hiſt r. Bohem. cap 35.</note> when it came to be divulged at <hi>Prage,</hi> certaine of the people cryed out with a loud voyce, that the Pope was Antichriſt, who ordained a Croyſadoe againſt Chriſtians: which perſons were preſently clapt vp in priſon, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ariſing in Armes, demanded them to be deliuered and ſet free, and when they were appeaſed by the Councill, with promiſe of aſſurance of their liues, and ſo returning to their houſes, the priſoners were ſecretly put to death. But their death was di couered by the blood that ranne vnder the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doore: whereupon, the people running againe together,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1279:29"/> tooke away their bodies by violence, and wrapping them in linnen clothes, carried them through all the Churches in the Citty, crying: <hi>Theſe are the Saints that haue deliuered their bodies to death, for the teſtament of God.</hi>

Whereupon our Sauiour ſitting vpon the Mount of <hi>Oliues,</hi> his diſciples ſaid vnto him, <hi>Tell vs when theſe things ſhall come to paſſe, and what ſhall be the ſigne of thy comming, and of the end of the world:</hi> which Queſtion ſtandeth vpon two parts: Firſt, concerning the deſtruction of the Temple, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſignes of the comming of the Sonne of God, and of the end of the world.

Now that which the Ieſuites here alledge, is the 14. verſe, which appertayneth yet to the firſt queſtion: and therefore when our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>That after the Goſpell ſhall be preached to all Nations, then the end ſhall be;</hi> hee vnderſtandeth not the worlds end, which is called in this Chapter <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> 1. It is manifeſt that <hi>Malachy</hi> ſpeaketh of the laſt comming of our Sauiour Chriſt, inſomuch that he calleth it, <hi>The great and terrible day of the Lord:</hi> and after addeth theſe words: <hi>leaſt I come and ſmite the earth with an Interdict:</hi> that is, leaſt comming to iudge the world, I condemne all the Rebellious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is certaine, that there is a double day of the Lord: one of his firſt comming, by the which he calleth the Elect to ſaluation: the other of his laſt comming, by the which hee gathereth to himſelfe thoſe that are ſaued, and brings them into his kingdome. Neither doe we gaineſay, but that both the one and the other, may be vnderſtood in this place: to wit, that the Prophet hauing promiſed the firſt comming of Chriſt, doth threaten them with the laſt, which ſhould not be conuerted by the firſt. But howſoeuer it be, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; that the ſending of <hi>Elias</hi> is referred by the Prophet, to the firſt comming of Chriſt: and not to the ſecond. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe words here, doe anſwer to them, Chap. 3. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and the Lord whom ye ſeeke ſhall ſpeedily enter into his Temple:</hi> which can poſſibly be applyed no otherwiſe then to the firſt comming of Chriſt. 2. Becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>That hee ſhall conuert the hearts of Fathers to their Children, and of Children to their Fathers:</hi> which both the Angell and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> enſpired with the ſpirit of Prophecy, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. referre to his firſt comming: and the matter it ſelfe beareth witneſſe thereunto. 3. In briefe, the ſame is euident by that which the Prophet addeth: <hi>Leaſt I come and ſtrike the earth with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1279:40"/> anathema:</hi> which is aſmuch as if he ſhould ſay, leaſt I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to haſten my ſecond comming, and cauſe them to feele the rigour of my Iudgement, if they conuert not vnto me by the tryall of my mercy in my firſt comming. For as touching the word which is tranſlated <hi>fearfull</hi> or <hi>terrible,</hi> it ſignifieth alſo honorable, or venerable, as it is tranſlated by <hi>Tremellius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iunius.</hi> And albeit thoſe words, <hi>fearfull,</hi> or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,</hi> ſhould be retained in the text, yet this hindereth not, but that this place may be well referred to the firſt comming of our Sauiour Chriſt. For though this comming, be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired time and the day of ſaluation to the Elect; yet it is fearfull and terrible to thoſe that in a blinded fury reiected him: according to that which old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid to the bleſſed Virgine, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.34. <hi>That he is appointed for the fall and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing againe of many in Iſrael, and for a ſigne which ſhall bee ſpoken againſt.</hi> Neither indeed can it be denied, but that this day was terrible to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> aſwell in regard of their blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and hardening, as alſo by reaſon of the great calamities which followed their rebellion. For was not their Land tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmitten as it were by <hi>Interdict,</hi> when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, ſackt, and burnt, by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespaſian,</hi> and the whole Common-wealth of the <hi>Iewes</hi> vtterly razed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Hence it is, that <hi>Rupertus</hi> expounding this text, ſaith, <hi>That he dares not certainly define any thing concerning the comming of Elias into the world: foraſmuch as many hold, that he muſt come in his proper perſon: and others, amongſt whom S. Ierome, deny it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Repl.</hi> 2. When our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>That Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt is Elias that ſhould come, he meaneth that (according to their iudgememt) that Iohn Baptiſt promiſed by the Prophet Malachy, is Elias; but not litterally, but allegorically, and that the true Elias ſhall come at the end of the world.</hi>

Secondly, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, ſeeing he hath not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the daily ſacrifice of the Church, but rather hath ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it with all manner of honours. And thirdly, that they that oppoſe themſelues againſt the Pope, are the fore-runners of Antichriſt, ſeeing they hold nothing in ſo much abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they doe this daily ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>The Prophecy ſpeaketh neither of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">Reſp.</note> nor of the ſeruice and pretended ſacrifice of the Chriſtian Church: but of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and of the daily ſacrifice of the Iewiſh Church: For from the time of the prophanation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſetting vp the abhominable Idoll of deſolation vpon the Altar of the Lord, by the commandement of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> vntill the purification and dedication of the ſaid Temple by <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> enterpaſſed a thouſand two hundred and ninty daies,<note place="margin">Scalig. de Emen dat. tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. lib. 6. pag. 547.</note> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his book of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of times hath notably diſcouered. So that the Allegoricall expoſitious of this Prophecy, cannot make any thing for the confirmation of this dreame: eſpecially ſeeing it hath bene before manifeſted, that it is againſt reaſon, to make men beleeue, that Antichriſt muſt cauſe the ſeruice of God to ceaſe. It is ſufficient, if vnder the ſhadow of Gods ſeruice, he ſhall bring in his abhominations, and make ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of worſhipping Chriſt, and honouring his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall depriue them of all efficacy and ſauing profit: as may be obſerued more particularly in the Maſſe: wherein vnder the pretext of offering a ſacrifice to God, it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs from receiuing from him, that which he offereth vnto vs: and by an imaginary ſacrifice, aboliſheth the truth of the Sacrament inſtituted by Chriſt. In which regard, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude three things directly oppoſite to thoſe three concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> to wit, Firſt, that Antichriſt is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, but that he is alſo reuealed, ſeeing inſtead of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1279:47"/> he impoſeth vpon the Church a ſacrifice. Secondly, that the Pope is this Antichriſt, foraſmuch as he ordaineth this ſacrifice, maintaineth it aboue all things, and graceth it with all kinds of honour. Laſtly, that it is ſo farre, that we who deteſt with all our hearts this ſacrifice, are ſore-runners of Antichriſt; that rather we are euery one, according to the guift of Gods grace, the inſtruments of the mouth of Chriſt, by whom he prepareth the deſtruction of Antichriſt: as on the other ſide, they that employ their tongues and pens, for the maintenance of this ſacrifice, are the miſerable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sathan, that ſhall be conſumed with the ſword of the mouth of the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.21.</note> when the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet ſhall be caſt into the Lake of fire and brimſtone.</p>
                  <p>Their fift demonſtration, is drawne from the durance of Antichriſt, whereof I ſhall ſpeake afterward in due order: as alſo of the ſixt, which is touching the end of the world, immediately (as they ſay) following the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt after three yeares and an halfe, to the end I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the order of the propoſed queſtions, according to the definition giuen of Antichriſt.</p>

The word Antichriſt is vſed onely in the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in no other place of holy Scripture, and it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a twofold ſignification: either generall for all that are enemies vnto Chriſt, or particular for that great enemie, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the man of ſinne. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. In the firſt ſenſe it is vſed by S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.18. and 22. and in his ſecond Epiſtle verſe ſeuen: and in the ſecond ſenſe he vſeth it. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By which it is apparant, that all the enemies of Chriſt and his Church, are in the generall acceptation of the word, Antichriſts. Now the enemies of Chriſt and his Church, may be diuided into two rankes, as they are by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.25.26. to wit, <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Touching the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who can expreſſe the rage and fury, wherewith they haue banded themſelues againſt our Sauiour Chriſt and his Church? The Scripture declareth with what malice they perſecuted Chriſt himſelfe whilſt he liued amongſt them, euen vntill they had brought him to the moſt ſhamefull and cruell death, crucifying him betwixt two theeues, and preferring <hi>Barrabas</hi> a murtherer before him, as if he had bene the greateſt malefactour in all the world: and alſo how after his reſurrection, they perſecuted his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. But if we conſult Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuill Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we ſhall finde, that they haue not ceaſed euer ſince to ſhew their malice to the very name of Chriſt, in their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Chriſtian children, and eſpecially Carpenters ſons, in deſpite of Ieſus the ſonne of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> who was a Carpenter:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1279:68"/> in poyſoning Riuers and Springs, and raiſing ſeditions in Cities, with many other horrible enormities. But as they haue encreaſed in malice againſt Chriſt, ſo Gods vengeance hath followed them vnto this day: For after that horrible deſolation of their prime City and whole Nation, by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespaſian,</hi> they againe reuolted and committed moſt fearfull outrages vpon Chriſtians, and all others in <hi>Lybia, Aegypt, Cyrenia, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> till they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, firſt by the Emperour <hi>Traiane,</hi> and then by <hi>Adrian</hi> his ſucceſſor, ſo diſperſed, deſtroyed, and torne in peeces, that till this day, they durſt neuer lift vp their hands in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique againſt the Church: yea by a moſt ſeuere edict of the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> (which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> writing vpon the firſt Chapter of <hi>Zephaniah</hi> maketh mention of) they were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited euer to enter into their owne Country; and ſo they are vagabonds and runnagates vpon the earth as <hi>Cain</hi> was, without Prince, Common-wealth, or Gouernment. And ſince me thinkes I ſee in <hi>Cain</hi> a notable repreſentation of this rebellious Nation: for he ſlew <hi>Abel</hi> the iuſt; ſo they, the iuſt One, the Lord of life, the Sonne of God: he was made a vagabond vpon the earth, and ſo are they: but yet as he had a marke ſet vpon him by God, that none ſhould ſlay him, ſo haue they; for God hath ſo marked them by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prouidence, that though they be hated of all men, yet they are not vtterly deſtroyed, nor mixt with other Nations by mariage, or any other ciuill or religious combination, as other ſtragling Nations haue bene. And that for two cauſes as it may ſeeme: one, that the vengeance of God might be ſtill viſible vpon them, for the confirmation of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith: and the other, becauſe God hath appointed a time of their conuerſion, and reception into mercy, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly ſheweth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26.

AS the manner of Traytors is, vnder pretence of the Kings name and authority to raiſe forces, ſeize vpon Cities and Caſtles, and ſend forth Edicts and Proclamations, but all againſt the King himſelfe, that they may depriue him of his Throne, and ſet vp whom they liſt in his roome: So doth Antichriſt vnder the name and authority of Chriſt, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance himſelfe againſt Chriſt, and in pretence that Chriſt is in body abſent from his Church, draw vnto himſelfe by a ſacrilegious vſurpation the gouernment thereof.

Where by the character, the name of the Beaſt, and the number of his name, in all probability is meant one and the ſame thing. So <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, Sixtus Senenſis, Alcazar,</hi> and others vnderſtand it: and thus the latter is ſtill the expoſition of the former: as if a man would know what is meant by the character, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith by way of expoſition, <hi>Or the name of the Beaſt:</hi> and what by the name of the Beaſt, he addeth: <hi>Or the number of

Which way ſoeuer it be taken, it is all to one effect, for the ſenſe of the Text.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This number, 666. is diuerſly interpreted by expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Text, and that principally two waies; either my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically, or literally. The myſticall expoſitions are foure. Firſt, ſome vnderſtand it of the time wherein Antichriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reigne and reueale himſelfe. Secondly, of the certaine degrees, by which this Beaſt doth captiuate men to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and homage; both theſe are expreſſed by the Authour and therefore I forbeare to ſpeake of them any further. The third interpretation, is by a certaine Lawyer called <hi>Caryon,</hi> in his Anatomy of Antichriſt, Chap. 21. who ſpeaking of this ſubiect, ſaith; that it is a faſhion of ſpeech taken from the Greekes &amp; Latines, in the cenſuring or numbering their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: for there was ſaith he) a twofold catalogue or nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them: The firſt, <hi>cenſus nominis,</hi> which euery Citizen was bound to giue vnto the Cenſour: the other, a declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the eſtate and reuenue of euery Citizen, wherby they were ranked in their ſeuerall degrees: and ſo that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> like
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1279:71"/> a Cenſour ſetteth downe, firſt the name, and ſecondly the demeanes of the Beaſt, which is 666. talents of gold yeerely comming in. And this (ſaith he) is the number of the reuenue of this myſtery, ariſing from his damnable trafficke of ſoules, anſwering in greatneſſe to that of rich <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that there came in vnto him euery yeere, 666. talents of Gold; which amounteth to betwixt fiue and ſix millions, an Hebrew Talent auayling in worth eight or nine thouſand Crownes, or ſix ſcore pounds of Gold, as both <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Budaeus</hi> affirme. The fourth myſticall interpretation, is that of <hi>Anſelme</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his Commentary vpon the Apocalyps, Chap. 13. who ſaith, by the number of ſix, which is the firſt perfect number, is mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now of theſe three degrees, the firſt bring forth fruite ſix fold; the ſecond, ſixty ſold; and the third, an hundred fold: and that the Diſciples of Antichriſt ſhall preach, that none can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In Greeke, there are found out many names that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this number. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> an Ancient Father and Scholler to <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> whom S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ordained the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> propoundeth three <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the firſt whereof he affirmeth nothing: but the ſecond (he ſaith) is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely and probable, becauſe it is the name of the great and laſt Kingdome, out of which Antichriſt was to ſprout. But the third he reſteth moſt vpon, <hi>vt maxima ſide dignum;</hi> as moſt worthy of beliefe. But by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his leaue, we may rather reſolue vpon the ſecond <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſpecified by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himſelfe: one, becauſe it is the name of the firſt Beaſt; and the other, becauſe Antichriſt is to impoſe that name vpon all men. But any one of the three doe fitly agree to the Romane Antichriſt. For firſt, touching the name <hi>Euanthas,</hi> it is aſmuch in ſignification, as happily flouriſhing: and what eſtate in the world is more flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in power, riches, and ſtately buildings, multitude of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, delightfull Gardens, and Meadowes, delicacy of meates, and all other things, that may ſerue either for pompe or pleaſure, then the State of the Romane Pope? There is not any thing in this world, either delightful to the eies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the heart of man, which he and his Cleargy enioyeth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1279:72"/> not. Their Palaces ſurpaſſe in ſtatelines the goodlieſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Kings, and Princes, and their Pompe is farre greater then any of them. For this cauſe, <hi>Politian</hi> obſerueth in the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ond Epiſtle of his firſt Booke, that Rome in their ancient Sacrifices was called by a ſecret name <hi>Anthuſa,</hi> which is as much in effect, as <hi>Euanthas,</hi> happily flouriſhing. Secondly, the name <hi>Titan,</hi> is one of the names of the Sunne, whom both the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> made an Idoll, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and carryeth with it an oſtentation of reuenge. And is not the Pope ſuch an Idoll? Hee is carryed aloft vpon mens ſhoulders, like the Goddeſſe <hi>Peſſenuntia,</hi> with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament carryed before him like the <hi>Perſian</hi> fire: all ſorts of men fall downe and worſhip him as a God vpon earth, and kiſſe his feete. And that he may not want the name of this Idoll, hee calleth himſelfe the greater light that ruleth the day, to wit the Church; that is, <hi>Titan,</hi> or the Sunne, and the Emperour the leſſer, to rule the night, to wit, the Layty. And as the Moone is ſubiect to the Sunne, and not the Sunne to the Moone, ſo Emperors and Kings are ſubiect to him, and not he to them: and as farre as the Sunne doth exceede the Moone in greatneſſe, ſo farre doth the Papall power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Emperiall: and as it is impoſſible for the Sunne to depend vpon the Moone, ſo it is for the authority of the Pope to depend vpon the Emperor: and as the Sunne is the Father and Lord of all the Planets, ſo is the Pope of all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dignities: and as all the Planets receiue their light from the Sunne, ſo doe all Biſhops their power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Pope. And laſtly, as the Sunne receiueth his light from the firſt mouer, and communicateth the ſame to all the reſt of the Starres: ſo the Pope deriueth his power immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God, and diſpenſeth the ſame to all the members of the Catholike Church. And as for the vengeance which this name <hi>Titan</hi> alſo importeth, who can doubt but that it fitteth him in this reſpect to an haire, that conſidereth with what Gyant-like violence hee hath aſſaulted Kings and Princes; ſometimes with the thunder-bolts of his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, wherewith the greateſt were wont to be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1279:73"/> as with lightning from heauen, ſometimes with open and bloody Warres, and ſometimes with ſecret Maſſacres, and treacherous deſignements: thus making as it were the earth to quake, and the ſtouteſt and greateſt hearts to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at his threats. Moſt fitly then by theſe two names wee haue a moſt liuely picture of this Man of ſinne: and yet I confeſſe they are not ſo grounded vpon the holy Scripture, as that we dare fully reſt vpon them.</p>

                  </gap>, which is the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and likely of all the reſt, though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> holds it not ſo. For firſt, the letters of that name exactly containe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 666. namely, if it be written with the Dipthong <gap reason="foreign">

But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that know the Greeke tongue better then they, and alſo wrote in Greeke, writeth it with the Dipthong, and not with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>iota.</hi> And whereas ſpeaking of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, he maketh no qualification, but taketh it for granted that it ought to be ſo written. And this learned <hi>Scaliger</hi> obſerued in his <hi>Animaduerſions</hi> vpon <hi>Euſebius Chron:</hi> that the Greekes vſed to turne the letter <hi>iota</hi> into the Dipthong <gap reason="foreign">

And the Pope hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped all the power and authority thereof into his hands, as alſo the City it ſelfe, and therefore why ſhould wee doubt but that the name Antichriſt is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; and ſo that the Pope is he without all queſtion? Laſtly, that he may plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that this name belongeth properly vnto him, and none elſe, he impoſeth this name vpon all that depend vpon him: his Church is called the Latine Church, ſo is the Apoſtolicall Sea: the publick Liturgie is commanded to bee Latine: ſo Prayers, Bulles, Indulgences, Maſſes, Veſpers, Mattens, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, Pleas, all <hi>Latine;</hi> yea, the holy Scripture it ſelfe by the Decree of the Counſell of <hi>Trent,</hi> is not authenticall, but in Latine.

But if we vnderſtand it ſpiritually, of the trafficke of ſoules, then is the caſe more cleare: for is not Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize made of ſoules of men in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and doe they not ſell them at a very low rate? Witneſſe their Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, Pardons, Maſſes, Trentals, <hi>Agnus deis,</hi> holy Graines, with a number more ſuch like fopperies, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with men for the price of their ſoules. And who are the traders in this Mart? But onely they, that haue receiued the marke of the Beaſt, who buy them for things of nought, and ſell them againe to the diuell for worſe then nought. Of this trafficke of ſoules, S. <hi>Peter</hi> prophecieth, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. That there ſhould ariſe vp in the Church falſe teachers, who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough couetouſnes ſhould with famed words make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of mens ſoules: that is, proſtitute the people of God vnto Sathan, and change the truth of God into gainefull fables. Theſe Merchants are all the Cleargy of the Papacy, who in their Sacrament of order, receiue the marke of the Beaſt. This is moſt apparant, by conſideration of the manner of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of their whole Cleargy, from the leaſt vnto the greateſt. The ſmaller orders, are theſe foure: Porters, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1279:79"/> Exorciſts, and Acoluths. The Porters at their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, receiue from the Biſhop the keyes of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their right hand: The Lector receiueth a booke, as alſo doth the Exorciſt with his right hand: and the Acolutha a Candleſtick with the candle put out: and by theſe ſeuerall ceremonies, they receiue the markes of their order, as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribed in the Romane Pontificall, <hi>Fol.</hi> 6.7.8.9. &amp;c. But before all this, they receiue their firſt tonſure, the Biſhop cutting off the end of their haire in foure places: to wit, on the forehead, behinde, and by the two eares. The greater orders are three: Subdeacon, Deacon, and Prieſt. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon receiues the Character of his order, by touching with his right hand the booke of the Epiſtles, as the Deacon doth by touching the booke of the Goſpels. As for the Prieſts, after that the Biſhop, with ſome other Prieſts aſſiſting, haue impoſed their hands vpon his head, which is an Euangelicall cuſtome; he then annoynteth both his hands with ſacred oyle, and then preſenteth vnto him a Chalice with wine and water, and a plate with an Hoaſt in it, which he receiueth in his fingers, touching withall the plate and the edge of the Chalice, and by this action (ſay they) is the marke of this order imprinted vpon him. The like may be obſerued in the higher dignities of the Cleargy, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Metropolitanes, Cardinals, all which, after their ſolemne oath of ſubiection to the Pope, as to their Leige-Lord, are really characterized with many markes and ceremonies. As Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, at their conſecration with holy oyle, put on the crownes of their heades, &amp; vpon their hands a Croſier ſtaffe, a booke, a ring, two torches, two loaues of bread, with two veſſels of wine, a Miter all beſprinkled with holy water, and a paire of hallowed gloues. All which ceremonies, as they are not to be found in the booke of God, ſo they can be counted nothing elſe but the Beaſts markes. As for Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Primates, and Patriarches; though they be choſen and conſecrated, yet they may not execute their authority, till they haue receiued from <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>Pall, Pallium,</hi> which <hi>Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or <hi>Pall,</hi> is a little narrow cloake made of white wooll,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1279:79"/> hallowed by the ſepulchres of Saint <hi>Peter and</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and after kept by the Subdeacons till it be purchaſed of the Pope with a great ſumme of money. And this is their marke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they can neither buy nor ſell in this Babyloniſh Faire. He that would ſee at large the foolery of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ceremony, let him read <hi>Durand</hi> his <hi>Rational. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinis lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. and the booke of Sacred Ceremonies. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10. <hi>cap</hi> 5. The character of the great Cardinal, is a red Hat with long Taſſels, by which they are knowne to be pillars of the world, (as their name in their fond conceit importeth,) and are made not onely the great Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of State to the Apoſtolicall Chaire, but euen partes and members of the great Biſhop himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By all this that hath beene ſpoken it is cleare, that all theſe diuers orders of the Cleargy, receiue the marke of the Beaſt; both in the forehead by an outward profeſſion, and recognition of their ſubiection to the Pope; and in their right hand, by actuall obedience: neither haue they onely the marke, but alſo the name, and number of the name: for as the name moſt likely is <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> doth require, that the very firſt orders are not to bee conferred vpon any, but ſuch as haue ſome skill in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue. I conclude then, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath ſet downe nothing touching the marke of the Beaſt, which doth not fitly agree to the Pope and his Cleargy.</p>

And theſe two different conſiderations, doe fall into each others: for therefore hee is ſaid to ſit in the Church of God, becauſe he ſitteth in the City with ſeuen hils, which taketh vpon her ſelfe the name of the Catholike Church: and therefore in the City with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hils, becauſe in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Temple wherein Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith Antichriſt ſhal fit, cannot be meant the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as ſome of the Fathers haue imagined, and the Papiſts accuratly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, as moſt fit for their Antichriſt, which they ſuppoſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of the nation of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and that for three reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was a type and a figure of the Church of Chriſt, and therefore as other types and figures did, ſo ought it to ceaſe at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the body and the truth: and therefore when the Church was gathered out of the Iewes and Gentiles, that Temple was to haue an end; they then that expect the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Temple, with the ſame labour expect the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Iewiſh Ceremonies.

Secondly, he ſits in it not as an ordina y member thereof, but as the head thereof, and ſo exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue it, as the head is aboue the members; and this the word, <hi>Set,</hi> doth emphatically declare: for to ſit is nothing

For firſt, it is certaine that the Church of Rome was once the true Church of Chriſt, and famous for her faith and godlines Secondly, that they ſtill pretend themſelues to be the onely Catholicke Church. And thirdly, we confeſſe, that they are ſtill a Church, though wonderfully corrupted and depraued, as a ſicke body that hath no ſoundneſſe in it, but yet ſtill holdeth life, for it hath in it the ſound doctrine of the Trinity, and Chriſtian Baptiſme, with all the Articles of the Faith. But
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1279:82"/> they haue added heereunto many fearefull Idolatries and groſſe corruptions, and ſo are like a maſſe of mettall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is ſome Gold, but more Tinne, Copper, Braſſe, Lead, and Droſſe. The vniuerſality of the name of the Church ſtretcheth it ſelfe to all that are dipped with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Baptiſme, and any waies profeſſe Chriſt: but of this body ſome parts are more ſound, other languiſh with diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſome againe are ſurprized (though yet breathing) with deadly Symtomes, and with death it ſelfe: of this latter kinde is the Church of Rome, which is poſſeſſed with a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſickneſſe, euen neere vnto death, from the crowne of the head, to the ſole of the foot. Now are we departed from the Church, becauſe we renounce her corruptions?

Doth a man therefore forſake his Country, becauſe he flyeth from one City infected with the plague, into another wherein the aire is purer within the ſame dition and dominion? This is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd a concluſion, that it needs no refutation. Fourthly, there is no doubt, but that in the midſt of this corrupt Church, there are many true members of the Church of Chriſt, who hate the abominations of the Scarlet Whore, and though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, yet ſincerely worſhip God in ſpirit and truth. And laſtly, after the ſame maner is the Church, wherein Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſitteth: as the Iewes were the people of God, when they had defiled themſelues with moſt filthy Idolatries: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we more to bee accounted Schiſmatikes for our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from this Synagogue of Satan, then the godly were among the Iewes, who obeying the admonitions of the Prophets, ſeparated themſelues from the ſociety of thoſe wicked Idolaters.</p>

Secondly, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was neuer but one and the ſame, wherein firſt the Pagan Emperours reigned, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> repreſenteth by the firſt Beaſt: and then after them, Antichriſt, which is the ſecond Beaſt, or at leaſt the ſeuenth head thereof.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1279:84"/> much changed in the buildings and edifices. All this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Ieſuite <hi>Ribera,</hi> writing vpon the 14. Chapter of the Apocalyps, <hi>art.</hi> 43. For he acknowledgeth, that it is for ſituation one and the ſame City ſtill, which being ſoiled with ſo many foule impieties, muſt one day be purged with fire: and that many in <hi>Rome</hi> at this day by their names and Genealogies, doe boaſt themſelues to be deſcended from the Ancient Romanes: and though they be not ſo deſcended, yet by ioyning themſelues vnto them, and making vp but one ioynt body of a Common-wealth, and following their foot-ſteeps of wickedneſſe, they are to be reputed the ſame Citizens and Children of thoſe vngodly parents, though not by nature, yet by imitation, and ſo are liable to the ſame plagues and puniſhments which were denounced againſt them: thus <hi>Ribera.</hi> And therefore <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſtinction of <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, and <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian is friuolous; for <hi>Rome</hi> hath euer bene, and is, but one and the ſame, wherein there euer were from the beginning of the preaching of the Goſpell to them, both Chriſtians and Pagans; and this <hi>Rome</hi> as it might in ſome ſenſe be called the purpled Whore, vnder the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the firſt Beaſt, ſo it doth much more continue to be, vnder the dominion of the ſecond Beaſt. Neither doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that Antichriſt ſhould therefore reigne in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> and other perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, though his myſtery began then to worke, according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. For <hi>Rome</hi> is not onely named the Whore of Babylon, in regard of the ſecond Beaſt, which is Antichriſt; but alſo in regard of the firſt, the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Thirdly, if <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan be the ſeate of Antichriſt, then <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is his ſeate; and then Antichriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, vnder the Heathen Emperours, both which they themſelues moſt ſtiffely deny. Fourthly, if the whole ſtate of the Romane Empire, be figured out by the Beaſt with ſeuen heads, whereof the ſixt was the Emperours, and the ſeuenth Antichriſt, as is confeſſed by moſt (though the name of the whole Beaſt be alſo attributed to Antichriſt, in the ſame Chapter by S. <hi>Iohn:</hi>) and if S. <hi>Iohn</hi> deſcribes the ſtate of the

Fiftly, if S. <hi>Iohn</hi> had meant to repreſent vnder the type of myſticall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, he would not haue deſcribed it as it was to be vnder the eight King, namely Antichriſt, who is called the eight, and yet is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sixtly, <hi>Rome</hi> is deſcribed by S. <hi>Iohn</hi> as it was to be a little before the laſt and finall deſtruction thereof, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18.21.22.23. and as vnder the reigne of Antichriſt: but in the time of the heathen Emperours, Antichriſt was not come by their owne confeſſion, neither hath it bene yet vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, though it was grieuouſly ſacked, ſpoiled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> yet it remaineth ſtill a famous City. It is impoſſible then, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould repreſent <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, wherein neither of theſe were performed. Seuenthly, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Rome</hi> in that eſtate which it was in, after the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Empire, it being diuided amongſt ten Kings, who were to receiue their Kingdome together with the Beaſt, that is, Antichriſt which can no waies agree to <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, for <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed to be Pagan before the diſſolution of the Empire, and neither the Beaſt, nor the ten Kings had then receiued their dominion. Eightly, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> prophecying of the Whore of Babylon and her idolatry, with the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, is rapt with admiration, and calleth it a myſtery: but if he had meant <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, what Prophecy, what myſtery, what matter of admiration had bene therein? Could either S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> or the Saints, be ignorant of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and cruelty of <hi>Rome</hi> Ethnicke, when they beheld them with their eies? Laſtly, thoſe things which are ſpoken of the Whore of Babylon, doe not agree at all to <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, to wit, that the Kings of the earth committed fornication with her, and that the inhabitants of the earth ſhould be made drunke with her wine. For ancient <hi>Rome</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure

That myſticall Babylon is the ſeate of Antichriſt, may be proued by diuers reaſons: I ſay myſticall Babylon, not the true Babylon in <hi>Chaeldea,</hi> properly ſo called, where, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes</hi> reigned, who was the type of Antichriſt: for the Woman in the Apocalyps, is ſaid to haue the name <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> written in her forehead, to wit, the great Babylon, the mother of fornications, &amp; abhominations of the earth, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.5. plainly thereby ſhewing, that that Babylon whereof S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, muſt be myſticall. Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi> Babylon was a type of this myſticall, and therefore as that was the ſeate of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the type: ſo this muſt needs be the ſeate of Antichriſt himſelfe.

No man is ſo ignorant as not to know this to be true, none ſo impudent as to deny it. The ſecond note is, that this Woman ſitteth vpon ſeuen hils: and this is the ſituation of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, for the wals of the City encloſe ſeuen hils: to wit, <hi>Palatine, Capitoline, Quirinall, Coelius, Eſquilme, Vininall,</hi> and <hi>Auentine,</hi> and therefore it is called in Greeke, <hi>Roma</hi>

Now this eight, is no other but the Pope of Rome, from the time of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the third, vntill this day, and forward to the end of the world: for fiue heads of this Empire, or fiue of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed Kings were ceaſed before <hi>Iohns</hi> time.

And if they ſay that the Pope is but the ſeuenth head, and that the eight is yet to come, which is Antichriſt: they muſt remember that the ſeuenth was to endure but a ſhort time; but the Popes kingdome is not ſhort, hauing continued theſe many hundred yeeres: out of all which it neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not onely that <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the Pope is <hi>Babylon,</hi> but alſo that the Pope himſelfe is Antichriſt, being the eight head of the Beaſt, and yet one of the ſeuen.</p>

The ten hornes, which by the Angels interpretation are ten Kings, that ſhall diuide the Romane Empire amongſt them, and ſhall receiue their power as Kings at one houre with the Beaſt, doe plainely intimate the ſame thing. For whereas the Weſterne Empire was diſſolued, and the power thereof taken by the Pope from the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror, then theſe ten Kings poſſeſſed the Prouinces, and the Pope the City of <hi>Rome</hi> at one time: and whereas it is ſaid, that firſt, with one conſent they gaue their power to the Beaſt, and <hi>fought againſt the Lambe,</hi> but after being called out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hated the Whore, and made her deſolate and naked; what can bee more plainely ſpoken to ſhew, that which by experience at this day is verified, to wit, when thoſe Kingdomes and Kings which at the firſt were ſlaues and ſubiects to the Pope, are now the greateſt enemies vnto him? which prophecy is already in part fulfilled, and ſhall do doubt in ſhort time bee fully accompliſhed.

For this King <hi>Iabin</hi> with his nine hundred Chariots of iron, and innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſouldiers, doth he not liuely repreſent the deſignes, leagues, and conſpiracies of Kings, and people, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, vnder the banner of Sathan and Antichriſt? And what did <hi>Debora,</hi> a feeble and diſarmed woman repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but the Church of Chriſt, ſtanding valiantly in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt all theſe aſſaults? And why is the Mountaine of <hi>Mageddon</hi> aſſigned to be the place, wherein this combate is to be fought, rather then any other? But to repreſent, that they that fight againſt the true Church, ſmall in ſtrength and number, in compariſon of her enemies, ſhall haue the ſame iſſue of their battailes, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> had againſt the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> of the two Tribes of <hi>Zabulon</hi> and <hi>Nephtalim,</hi> neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the waters of <hi>Mageddoni</hi> where they were all ſlaine euen to one, as it is euident, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 4.16. and <hi>Iudges.</hi> 5.19.

As therefore the holy Scripture deſcribeth Antichriſt by the name of a man; ſo it giueth vs iuſt occaſion to obſerue in him the like progreſſes and changes as are found in the life of a man. As therefore the life of a man is diuided into ſeuen principall periods or peeces, to wit, Birth, Infancy, Youth, Mans eſtate, Declining age, Old age, and Death: ſo Antichriſt hath the ſame degrees and ſtaires, from his firſt entrance into the world, vntill his finall end and diſſolution. For it muſt needs fare with this Kingdome and Empire of Antichriſt, as it hath done with all other Kingdomes and Empires of the world, which haue growne from ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings to a great height and ſtrength, and after by litle and litle decayed againe, till they come to their finall ruine.

His Declining, when he ſaith, the Lord ſhall conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth, that is, with the preaching of the Goſpell: and laſtly, his Old age and death, when hee ſaith, that after his conſumption he ſhall bee deſtroyed with the brightneſſe of Chriſts comming.

               <p n="3">3. Antichriſts birth was without doubt in the Apoſtles time, ſeeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the myſtery of iniquity did then worke; and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Antichriſt was already come into the world. Now hee could not come before Chriſt, for how could he then be Antichriſt? Therefore it is an vndoubted truth, that he was borne in the Apoſtles time: and yet no man can expreſly define in what yeere, moneth, or day he was borne; for his comming was into the Church as a diſeaſe into the body vnknowne and ſecret: neither can the place of his birth be determined, whether in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in any other City of the world. And as for <hi>Rome,</hi> wee are ſo farre from affixing the title of Antichriſt to thoſe holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that were firſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> that we confeſſe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then propoſed to other Churches as a rare example of ſanctity of life, and purity of doctrine, and conſtancy in martyrdome: yet howſoeuer it is impoſſible to determine either the time or place of his birth, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he was borne in the Apoſtles time, is ſo euident a truth, that he that will deny it, muſt withall deny the holy Scripture wherein it is plainely affirmed.</p>

And that in the firſt ſignification, the title is prophane, ſacrilegious, and proper vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: but in the ſecond, it may be attributed to the Pope, according to S. <hi>Gregories</hi> intention. This, I ſay, is an idle conceite: for he that ſhall aduiſedly read S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the fore-named places, ſhall finde, that he doth not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it in the firſt ſenſe, but in the ſecond alſo, namely, that one ſhould vſurpe that title to himſelfe, depriuing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it, ſeeing it is apparant in the Ancient Councils that all the Patriarches in common, beare the title of oecumenicall or vniuerſall Biſhops, without derogating thereby one from the other. And therefore if the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (as they pretend) or any other Councill, did at any time giue the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> this title, it was in common as to a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and not in any ſingular manner: As the care of all the Churches was committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> but not in priuate, but in

But the ſecond cannot properly agree to any, but to an infinite perſon, to wit, Ieſus Chriſt, and if it be aſcribed to any, it is not in regard of prehemiennce, that he ſhould haue aboue all others, but in regard of the vniuer ality of care, he ought to ſhew towards the whole Catholike or vniuerſall Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This was the firſt degree of Antichriſts reigne or Kingdome. The ſecond was, when the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhooke off from their neckes the yoke of obedience and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, which they ought vnto the Emperours: for, for a long time, the Pope was choſen by the common voyces of the Cleargy, and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and this election was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Emperour himſelfe, or by his Lieutenant,<note place="margin">Platina.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1279:101"/> he had chaſed the Emperours authority wholly out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Then Pope <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Philippious</hi> (who indeed was a fauourer of the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi>) and forbad the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> either to acknowledge him for their Lord, or to obey any Mandate or Commandement that came out by his authority. Then <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the ſecond, reſiſted the decree of the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> the third, who in zeale to Gods glory, had commanded all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches to be beaten downe, and ſo maintained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the fauour of <hi>Charles Martell</hi> againſt him, that the Emperour durſt not giue aſſault vpon him by Armes Then Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſecond, by the aide of <hi>Pepin,</hi> then King of <hi>France,</hi> wrung out of <hi>Arſtulphus</hi> the King of the <hi>Lumbards</hi> hands, not onely the rightes and territories of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but the whole Exarchate of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> with all the dependances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, &amp; beſtowed it vpon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> And yet their ambition was not ſatiate herewith, for they reſted not till the Kingdome of the <hi>Lumbards</hi> was vtterly rooted out by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſucceſſour of <hi>Pepin,</hi> who hauing conquered <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> their laſt King, added vnto his Fathers guifts, all that lieth beyond <hi>Liguria,</hi> from the old ruines of the City <hi>Luna,</hi> vnto the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and much elſe where: And this is that which is called S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, which they defrauding their true benefactours of that acknowledgement which is due vnto them, had rather aſcribe to the donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Here then we may ſee two notable euents. Firſt, the Pope aſpired vnto two hornes, to wit, both ſpirituall and temporall authority, and ſo became a temporall Prince in thoſe great territories which were conferred vpon him.

That Antichriſt ſhould command the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, to make an image of the firſt Beaſt, to giue him a ſpirit, and to cauſe him to be worſhipped. This is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1279:101"/> ſo manifeſt a token of Antichriſt, that it cannot be doubted of, whether we reſpect the erection and tranſlation of this new Empire, which is a power onely proper vnto God: or the bringing into the Church the adoration of Images, and the canonization of Saints, which was a kinde of giuing life to the image of the firſt Beaſt, with whom it was accuſtomed both to worſhip dumbe Idols, of wood and ſtone, and to conſecrate and deifie mortall men, as they pleaſed. For this cauſe, many learned men haue fixed the number 666. vpon this time, as the true beginning of the reuelation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome: for if we adde to 97 yeeres of Chriſt, which were runne when the Apocalyps was written, 666. we ſhall fall vpon the yeere of 762. in which the Pope as an earthly Prince, poſſ ſſed the Exarchate of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and thoſe other territories, which he rece ued by the gift of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, that at this time, the liues of the Popes were ſo filthy and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it would yrke any Chriſtian heart to read ſuch things as are written of them by their owne writers. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Benno</hi> repreſenteth vnto our view, a map of ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible monſters and incarnate diuels, liuing at that time in the Romane Sea, as the earth neuer bore the like. And of this time, the Author of the booke called, <hi>Faſciculus temporum,</hi> thus ſpeaketh. <hi>An effeminate time, wherein the Chriſtian faith began greatly to ſaile, and decline from it maſculine vigour: for then Sacraments, and Eccleſiaſticall Ceremonies, were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, but the people gaue themſelues to Southſayings, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments, and Necromancy: and as were the people, ſo were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly and laſtly, that at this time the pride of the Romane Biſhops was growne to ſuch an exceſſiue height, as is almoſt incredible: for they conſtrained Emperors and Kings to kiſſe their feet, to hold their ſtirrop when they got on horſebacke, to miniſter water vnto them for the waſhing of their hands when they went to meate, to waite for acceſſe vnto them at their gates, till it were their pleaſure to admit them to their preſence; and finally, they were not aſhamed to trample vpon their necks, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did to the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt, and to ſet the Crowne on their heads with one foot, and kicke it off againe with the other, with infinite other moſt arrogant demeanors. All which things laid together, doe exactly conclude, that euer ſince <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, the Pope hath beene the true and grand Antichriſt, albeit his tyrrany and pride encreaſed by degrees till <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, when it was aſcended to his higheſt period.</p>

This declining eſtate of the Man of ſinne began, when <hi>Martin Luther</hi> diſpelling the miſts of Popery, preached the glorious Goſpell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to the world, and eſpecially cleared the doctrine of Iuſtification, which till then lay cloaked vnder the vaile of Scholaſticall diſtinctions, and Monkiſh deuotion.

I omit that they conſtraine all their Diſciples to worſhip Images, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and perſecute all them for Heretikes that refuſe this ſeruice. And albeit theſe Images cannot be ſaid to be por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitures of the Beaſt, to wit, <hi>the Romane State,</hi> for this was to erect an ougly Image with ſeuen heads and ten hornes; yet they may truly be called his Images, both becauſe they are made in fauour of him, and hee alſo poſſeſſeth and cauſeth them to be adored. As <hi>Laban Gen.</hi> 32. and <hi>Micah, Iud.</hi> 18. call the Images which <hi>Rahel</hi> and the <hi>Danites</hi> had ſtollen f om them, their Gods; becauſe they made, worſhipped, and poſſeſſed them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus literally may this prophecy rightly bee applyed to the Pope: and as literally, ſo may it morally alſo. For as by the Beaſt is meant the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, ſo the Image of that beaſt is nothing elſe but the repreſentation of that Empire, and this is notably verified in the Weſterne Empire erected by the Popes, firſt in <hi>France,</hi> and after in <hi>Germany.</hi> For as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m ges retaine the name, and a certaine outward ſimilitude of the prototype, but are vtterly void of the Nature and eſſence thereof: ſo theſe new Emperors of the Weſt, bore the name and title of the ancient Roman Emperors, and were adorned with Imperiall Ornaments and prerogatiues of honour, yet wanted the power and Maieſty of the ancient Empire, wherein its life conſiſted. For the ancient Emperors ruled ouer <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prouinces ſubiect thereunto: but theſe neither haue dominion ouer <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ouer any ancient Prouince of the Empire: but are a bare title and name with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thing. Now the Pope hath giuen a ſpirit vnto this Image, that is, an Imperiall dignity and ſpeech, that is, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1279:106"/> to make Lawes and Decrees. So that ſeeing the Pope after the decay of the old Eaſterne Empire was the erection of this new in the Weſt, creating the firſt Emperor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a Colledge of Electors for the choiſe of new in their ſucceſſion, and confirming the choiſe by his authority; we may deſeruedly conclude, that he is the ſecond Beaſt, that is Antichriſt, which made an Image, and gaue life and ſpeech to the firſt Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ſo it is alſo morally fit and true: but if we take it in a myſticall ſenſe, then the Image of the Beaſt is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy it ſelfe, eſpecially ſince it vſurped both the Spiritual and Temporall Monarchy of the world. For the ancient Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors held an abſolute and vniuerſall power ouer the whole world; ſo doth the Pope challenge vnto himſelfe the like power and authority ouer all Creatures, yea more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any Emperor did; ouer the Angels in heauen, Soules i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. For the clearing of this point, it is further to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that the ſecond Beaſt ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the power of the firſt in his preſence, and cauſe the earth and them that dwell therein, to worſhip the firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.12. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is ſo clearly accompliſhed in the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that no man that hath but common reaſon can doubt thereof.

So that if we regard the thing it ſelfe, the Papacy and the Empire, is one and the ſame in effect. But if we conſider the outward faſhion and appearance, the Pope to blind mens eies, hath changed the name, and vnder pretence of his double power, vſurped a Soueraigne authority ouer the whole world. The power then of the firſt Beaſt, which Antichriſt ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, is onely this; that as the Romane Emperours challenged a Soueraignty ouer all the Prouinces and Kingdomes of the earth: So the Popes in like pride, vaunt of the like power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all Kingdomes to appertaine vnto them: which how fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be called the Image of the Beaſt, let all men iudge. For proofe of all this, let vs heare one of their owne Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,

                  <hi>Auguſtinus Stenchus,</hi> in his booke <hi>de donat. Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini.</hi> In one place whereof he ſaith, that the Maieſty of the Romane Empire, was reuiued in the Papacy, which though it was not attained to the ſame greatneſſe, yet it retained a certaine forme (or if you will image) thereof: and this he would deriue from the donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who (as he affirmeth) quitting <hi>Rome,</hi> gaue it and all the Weſt, to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prince then himſelfe, the Pope.

And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, to ſhew that this ſecond Beaſt the Papacy, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the firſt to be worſhipped and adored, he ſaith that by this donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Empire was not impaired, but augmented and ennobled: for it reuiued the power and language thereof, which were quite both defaced, and gaue new life vnto it, when it was well-neere dead: yea whereas before it was onely a temporall dominion, now it inueſted it with both ſwords, and ſo the Papacy ſupported the Empire, which was ready to fall, and made it againe famous through the whole world. And as touching the deadly wound of the firſt Beaſt, which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith was healed: ſome are of opinion, that this Prophecy was then fulfilled, when as the line of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> was cut off by the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> and the Empire tranſlated to another ſtocke, which healed the wound thereof, and made the eſtate more flouriſhing, then euer it had bene before. But I thinke rather by it to be meant, the baniſhing of the Emperours out of the Weſt, which was the wound, and erecting a new Empire in ſtead thereof, which was as it were the healing of the wound: and all this brought to paſſe, by the power and meanes of the Pope, whoſe eſtate is the ſecond Beaſt, and beareth the image of the firſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. SAint <hi>Iohn, Apoc.</hi> 13.11. ſaith, <hi>That he ſaw in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit another Beaſt, comming vp out of the earth, hauing two hornes like a Lambe, but ſpeaking as a Dragon.</hi> In which words, the Spirit of God doth reueale vnto vs by certaine circumſtances, a notable deſcription of Antichriſt, who is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated vnto vs by this ſecond Beaſt. For by thoſe two Beaſts mentioned in this Chapter, is figured out the double Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the moſt cruell tyrants and perſecutors of the Church of Chriſt, ſitting and reigning in one and the ſame City, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Babylon: as the foure Monarchies repreſented by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> reigned ſucceſſiuely in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Babylon, which was a type of this. So that as the firſt Beaſt, repreſented the State and dominion of the Romane Emperours, ſo the ſecond without doubt, demonſtrated the Papall Empire, wherein Antichriſt was to reigne. This I ſay, will moſt euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if we ſhall aduiſedly conſider three notable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt circumſtance is, of the time when this Beaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, to wit, after a great confuſion of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by bloody wars: for in the tenth verſ. immediately going before, it is ſaid, <hi>He that leadeth into captiuity, ſhal be led into captiuity, and he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword:</hi> and then preſently S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth: <hi>I ſaw another Beaſt riſing out of the earth.</hi> By which it is plaine, that when the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was reduced into that miſery, that there was nothing in it, but murther, bloodſhed, and confuſion, then was the time of Antichriſts appearance. Now there is no man ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in hiſtory, that knoweth not how the Empire and City of <hi>Rome,</hi> was hareſſed and ſpoiled by the barbarous <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and other Nations, inſomuch that it was almoſt brought to vtter deſolation, eſpecially in the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1279:109"/> Weſt: and how preſently after theſe broyles, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into the hands of the Pope, the whole dignity of the Romane name, ſetling it ſelfe in him. For though there is at this day a Prince that beareth the name of the King of the Romanes, or Emperour of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet he hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in <hi>Rome,</hi> it is the Pope onely that ruleth in that City.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, it is ſaid, that this Beaſt aroſe out of the earth, that is, from a baſe and low eſtate, and from ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and as it were out of the duſt, exalting it ſelfe by degrees vnto that height: which circumſtance alſo fitteth the Pope to an haire. For at the firſt, the condition of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> was humble and baſe, vnlike in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment euer to aſcend to that greatneſſe, which it after came vnto. They were poore men, liuing by the labour of their hands, and eating their bread from the ſweat of their browes S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, whom they falſly brag to haue bene Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a poore fiſherman, wanting money to pay the ordinary tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> till Chriſt ſupplyed it by a miracle: And <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.6. confeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>Siluer and Gold he had none:</hi> And the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> time, as <hi>Mantuan</hi> vnder the perſon of <hi>Teleſphorus,</hi> that liued. <hi>An.</hi> 142. reporteth, gaue themſelues to ploughing the earth, planting of Orchards, making of Gardens, digging and deriuing of Riuers, with many other ſuch like manuall exerciſes to keepe them from idleneſſe. <hi>Mantuans</hi> verſes are worth the reading, touching this ſubiect. But beſides this, he that ſhall looke but ſomewhat neerely into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Popes, ſhall eaſily diſcerne, that the Papall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is meerly earthly, little ſauouring of heauen and heauenly things. For what erected the Papacy, but the ambition of earthly men? The Ancient Councils declare, that the true cauſe of the Papall primacy ouer other Biſhops, was neuer the commandement of Chriſt, nor the holineſſe of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, but only the prerogatiue of the Imperiall City where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſate. Hence they obtained the firſt degree of honour and dignity amongſt other Biſhops; as afterwards the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> obtained the next or equall prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1279:109"/> by reaſon that that City was made the ſeate of the Empire, being tranſlated thither by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

By how much the more I wonder at their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or blindneſſe, that ſhould obtrude that for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which hath not ſo much as the leaſt probability of reaſon: for as this dreame hath no ground in holy Scripture, as may eaſily appeare by the ſolid anſweres giuen by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to thoſe arguments which are deriued from thence; ſo the opinions of the ancient Fathers are ſo diſcordant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues, and ſo variable and enterfering with each other, that no man of ſound iudgement will deriue a demonſtration from them. It is an opinion of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that Antichriſt ſhould deſcend out of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> which notwithſtanding <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reiecteth as erronious, and why ſhould he then cleaue to this deui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. The ground of this conceit is out of, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.2. where it is ſaid, that the holy City ſhould be troden vnder foote by the Gentiles two and forty moneths: at which time, Chriſt promiſeth, that he will giue power to his two witneſſes to prophecy, 1260. daies. And that their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being ended, they ſhould be ſlaine by the Beaſt, their dead bodies lying in the ſtreets of the great City, and that after three daies and an halfe, the ſpirit of life ſhould enter into them againe: and by that miracle, the Iewes ſhould be conuerted. Hence was that fable framed, that the Iewes vnder the conduct of Antichriſt, ſhould poſſeſſe the City of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that thoſe two witneſſes which ſhould riſe vp againſt him, were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who were for this purpoſe reſerued aliue in Paradiſe, to come againe in the end of the world, to oppoſe againſt Antichriſt; and at laſt after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhould ouercome him in <hi>Mount Oliuet,</hi> and then fiue and forty daies interceding, ſhould bee the ſecond comming of Chriſt. This is the fable which hangs ſo ill together, as no man can beleeue it without hazard of his wits. For firſt, how can it be that by theſe two witneſſes ſhould be preciſely vnderſtood two men, and no more, ſeeing it is ſaid in the ninth verſe, <hi>That people, and kindreds, and tongues, and Gentiles ſhould ſee their corpſes three daies and an halfe,</hi> were of all Nations and people of the world gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to ſee this ſpectacle? And againe in the tenth verſe it is ſaid, That theſe two Prophets vexed them that dwelt vpon earth: and is it likely that two were enough to trouble the whole world with their preaching, and to turne them into this rage and fury?

                  </gap>erſecuted in all Ages, we ſhall eaſily ſubſcribe to this truth. For after the ten firſt perſecutions, wherein it was ſcattered and ſpoiled like a ſhip in a tempeſt, did it not againe reuiue and recouer life, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gaue peace vnto it? So afterward, in the time of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, wherewith it was long tormented as with a burning feuer; was it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reſtored as it were to life and ſafety, by the faithfulnes of Chriſtian Emperours, and diligence of godly Biſhops? In the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, how were the faithfull perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and tormented, till within three yeeres and an halfe before his death, when his perſecutions ceaſed, and the Church tooke a little breath and reſt? But of all, this is moſt apparant after the Councill of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> were put to death: for immediately after that Council, which laſted three yeeres &amp; an halfe, theſe two witneſſes ſtood againe as it were on their feete, and the ſpirit of life entred into them, not in their owne perſons, but in their doctrine, which being condemned by that Popiſh Councill, began to ſpread it ſelfe and to preuaile, and to haue more followers and abetters, then euer it had before: and that not onely in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but after an hundred yeeres, in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Countries, as the ſame holy Martyr <hi>Huſſe</hi> had prophecied at the houre of his death. And indeed it is ſtrange to conſider, what a number of excellent, learned, and holy men God ſtirred vp at that time, to enter combate with the Pope, and to batter downe the wals of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and thus this Prophecy is euery way accompliſhed, if it be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and rightly vnderſtood.</p>

Firſt, that if it were true that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> or any two other men, ſhould come into the world to oppugne Antichriſt; yet it cannot be concluded, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, becauſe theſe two are not yet come, ſeeing they may yet come in due time: vnleſſe they can proue, that the world ſhall haue an end, within theſe foure yeeres, or 1335. daies, which one anſwer, is ſufficient to ouerthrow their whole demonſtration. Secondly, it is moſt probable, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh not of Antichriſt in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. THat the perſecution vnder Antichriſt ſhall be great, is no queſtion: but that it ſhall be greater then any euer was, or ſhall be beſides, cannot be proued by any ſound teſtimony of Scripture, as this Author hath moſt exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But yet if this be granted, as we willingly condeſcend thereunto, I ſay that the perſecution of the true Church by
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1279:119"/> the Popes, and of the faithfull Profeſſors of the Goſpell, hath beene, and is at this day, more cruell and greeuous, then euer any perſecution was in former time, either by <hi>Antiochus</hi> amongſt the Iewes, or the heathen Emperors amongſt Chriſtians. For firſt, <hi>Antiochus</hi> perſecuted the true Church that was onely among the Iewes, but the Pope hath exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his perſecution to all Nations and Countries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, the leaſt of which Countries farre exceeded in largneſſe the Iewiſh Nation. Secondly, <hi>Antiochus</hi> his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was but for a ſhort time, not much aboue three yeeres, but the Popes perſecution, hath continued in full ſtrength and force, theſe eight hundred yeeres and vpward. And laſtly, the number of Chriſtians that haue beene ſlaine by Popes, doth farre exceede the number of the Iewes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> ſo that there is no compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. The like may be ſaid of the Romane heathen Emperors, the limits of whoſe perſecution was ſtraighter, the time ſhorter, and the number fewer, then that of Popes by many degrees, as the hiſtories of the Church manifeſtly proue vnto vs. So that this conſideration aboue all others, proues the Pope to be Antichriſt, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who is ſaid to be drunke with the blood of the Saints and of the Martyrs of Ieſus, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 17.6.</p>

                     </gap>oſta,</hi> and <hi>Sanfaleſe:</hi> my heart trembles to relate the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were there made of ſimple people, armed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but prayers and teares: there was no difference made of ſex or age: women great with child were miſerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murthered; yong infants <hi>Herod</hi>-like thruſt through with ſpeares, and ſwords: forty women ſhut vp in a Barne full of hay and ſtraw, were conſumed with fire: and when they laboured to get out at the windowes, they were beaten backe with ſpeares and ſtaues: fiue and twenty men being fled into a Caue, were there ſtifled with ſmoke and fire: 800. were ſlaine outright in <hi>Cabriers,</hi> and a great multitude of poore people beſide maſſacred in all places: yea, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the men, or rather their Religion, theſe Tygers cut downe the Trees, not ſparing the fruitfull according to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1279:121"/> the Law: burnt the houſes, and ruined the Caſtels, and ſo made the whole Country deſert and deſolate. The ſecond is the tragicall <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day in <hi>France,</hi> vnder the colour of a royall marriage, in the yeere, 1572. to which all the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Pagans</hi> are not to be compared, no not that of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> whereby, 17000. Chriſtians were murdered in one moneth: for heere. (as ſome ſay) 40000. as others, that ſpeake with the leaſt, 30000. poore <hi>Hugonites</hi> as they call them, that is, ſound and good Chriſtians were ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in leſſe then a moneth. And of this Maſſacre the Pope would needes haue the glory, or rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy: for in ioy thereof, hee cauſed a certaine coine to bee ſtamped, wherein on the one ſide was the picture of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the thirteenth then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with this inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Gregor.</hi> 13. <hi>Anno.</hi> 10. <hi>ſummi ſui pontificatus,</hi> and on the other was repreſented an Angell, hauing a Croſſe in one hand, and a Sword in the other, killing a multitude of men and women with this inſcription, <hi>Hugonotorum ſtrages,</hi> that is, <hi>The maſſacre of the Hugonotes.</hi> And not content heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to the end that he might glut his eyes with his owne cruelty, he cauſed this maſſacre to bee painted in three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places in the great Hall, where he vſed to giue audience to the Embaſſadors of Princes: this is an example of cruelty, not to be paralelled by any former times, in any Age of the world. The third, is the horrible and vnmatchable Powder Treaſon heere in <hi>England,</hi> which though it came not to that effect they deſired, (God in mercy diſcouering their helliſh deſigne the night before the blow ſhould haue beene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,) yet in their intention and purpoſe, which is the life of all actions, it was the moſt cruell practiſe that euer the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held like vnto that of <hi>Caligula,</hi> that wiſhed that all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Senators and people had but one head, that hee might ſtrike it off at one blow. I neede not enlarge the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their intentions in this plot, the thing it ſelfe cryeth cruelty, and the latenes of the deſignement cannot but fix it faſt in our mindes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence deriue three conſequents. Firſt, if the greateſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1279:121"/> perſecution that euer was, be a marke of Antichriſt, then is the Pope Antichriſt: for neuer was there ſuch a perſecutor of the Church of Chriſt, as he is, and hath beene. Secondly, that it is a moſt vile and palpable lie, which they faſten vpon our Religion and Church that it began with <hi>Luther,</hi> and is no elder then his age; this they whiſper euery day into the eares of ſimple people, and divulge in their Sermons and writings: but doubtleſſe againſt their conſcience: for there are few leaues in their Annals and Church hiſtories, which are not marked with the blood of our Martyrs; and they themſelues cannot deny, but that 400. yeeres before <hi>Luther</hi> was borne, their Fathers perſecuted to death, and that by moſt cruell torments, a number that profeſſed the ſame Religion with vs in ſubſtance, though not ſo fully reuealed vnto them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thicke darkneſſe of that Age. And thirdly, that ours, not theirs, is the perſecuted Church. For though heere in <hi>England,</hi> and elſewhere the publike exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is forbidden, and men by mulct conſtrained either to communicate with vs in the ſeruice of God, and holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, or to ſuffer, and alſo diuers Prieſts and Ieſuites haue beene executed by the edge of Law: yet for their number it is not one to a thouſand to thoſe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that haue beene put to death by them: and for this cauſe, ours is Religion meerely, theirs rebellion and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of politike Lawes, againſt which they willingly daſh themſelues by their voluntary thruſting themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome, to ſeduce the people, and withdraw their hearts from their allegiance to their Soueraigne. This is ſo knowne a truth, that I need not ſtand further to proue it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the cruelty of Antichriſts perſecution they aſcribe as a principall effect, the aboliſhing of the publike ſeruice and ſacrifice of the Church, which they gather out of the twelfth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and becauſe the Maſſe is not yet aboliſhed which is their great vnbloody ſacrifice, therefore Antichriſt is not yet come, and ſo the Pope is not Antichriſt: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is moſt exactly confuted by the Author of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: but yet to cleare the matter further, I adde a note or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1279:122"/> two. And firſt, it is obſeruable, that the ſacrifices of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are either priuate, or publike: priuate Sacrifices, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> liuing, holy, and acceptable Sacrifice vnto God, <hi>Rom</hi> 12.1. which kinde of Sacrifice is ſo farre from being aboliſhed by any perſecution, that it is thereby rather effected, when the faithfull willingly offer their bodies to death, and all maner of torments for the truths ſake. Secondly, the ſpirituall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Chriſtians, are Prayers, Thankſgiuings, Almes, and a contrite and humble heart, none of which can be aboliſhed by Antichriſt except the Church of God ſhould bee vtterly deſtroyed, which is impoſſible: neither ſhall the publike Sacrifices and Ceremonies of the Church then ceaſe, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and an externall profeſſion of Chriſtianity. For Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, and ſhall haue two hornes like the Lambe, though he ſpeake like the Dragon,<note place="margin">Remon. de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. c. 29. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.11. For this cauſe <hi>Remond</hi> is of opinion, contrary to the Tenet of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Antichriſt, ſhall not aboliſh the Maſſe which they eſteeme to be the onely true Sacrifice of a Chriſtians: and therefore that that prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is to be vnderſtood of the Sacrifices of the Law interrupted by <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as witneſſe both Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and the Author of the booke of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> True it is, <hi>Iraeneus, Theodoret,</hi>

Howbeit euen thus alſo it may be fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Pope: for he hath changed the whole ſeruice of God anciently practiſed in the Church, and in ſtead thereof brought in a number of vaine obſeruations, and impious ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, as much different from that which was in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, as Lead is from Gold, or durt from precious ſtone. For whereas the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion in regard of practiſe, conſiſteth in theſe three points; the inuocating of Gods name, Preaching and hearing the word, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1279:122"/> of the Sacraments; hee hath foully depraued and corrupted all theſe. In ſtead of inuocating the name of God, he hath brought in Prayers in an vnknown tongue, inuocation of Angels and Saints departed, yea the worſhip of Images, Croſſes, and Relikes, and of a peece of bread which they call their God: and oftentimes the Saints which they adore, are ſuch as neuer were liuing in the world, but meere <hi>Chimeraes</hi> of their owne braine: and that which is ſtrange, euen Pagan Idolls vnder their name: as in the Temple of the <hi>Vaticane</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the title of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> they adore <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus,</hi> as is euident by the haire of the Image, which is curled and frizled: whereas Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is alwaies painted bald, onely they haue taken away the thunderbolt out of his hand, and thruſt in keyes in ſtead thereof. And at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> Church at the entrance of the Quire, they make the image of <hi>Iupiter</hi> mounting vp into heauen vpon an Eagles backe, to repreſent the aſcenſion of Chriſt. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the preaching of the Goſpell, is it not apparant that the greateſt part of Gods word is deliuered to the people in an vnknowne tongue? And what doe their new vpſtart Friars neuer heard of in the world till of late yeeres, which are their great and almoſt onely Predicants? I ſay, what doe they preach for the moſt part, but the rotten traditions of the Church, and legendary fables to amaze mens mindes, and nuzzle them in ſuperſtition? And touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is lamentable to ſee how they haue changed, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, mangled, and prophaned them: adding vnto the bleſſed Sacrament of Baptiſme a number of vaine, idle, yea filthy ſuperſtitions, as Salt, Creame, Spettle, Oyle, and ſuch like: as if Chriſt was not wiſe enough when he appointed water onely without any other mixture. And the holy Euchariſt they mangle, peruert, and abuſe, according to their owne fanſies, taking away the one ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fe from the people, to wit, the Cup, the liuely repreſentation of Chriſts blood, not breaking the bread as it ought to bee by inſtitution; nor communicating with the people, but oftentimes alone, contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Communion: and that which is moſt ſtrange, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1279:123"/> the Hoaſt: which they ſay is very Chriſt, to protect him from the diuell: as if Chriſt ſtood in feare of the diuell, or that the Croſſe did ſanctifie him, and not hee the Croſſe. Thus the Pope hath depraued, if not vtterly aboliſhed the whole externall ſeruice of God, and therefore euen in this reſpect alſo wee may conclude, that he is the true Antichriſt ſpoken of in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Maſſe indeed continueth vnder him, and is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with great pompe, and the Fathers call it the ſacrifice of the Church: but how? Not a true and reall ſacrifice, as the Papiſts hold, but becauſe by the Lords Supper is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church a recordation, and memoriall of the death and paſſion of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Aug. de doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.

                  </note> Thus Saint <hi>Auguſtine: Wee</hi> (at the Euchariſt) <hi>partake of the paſſion of our Lord, and with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and profit retaine in our memory that his fleſh was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for vs.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Theophilact. ad.

So that wee confeſſe, that the Pope doth not aboliſh the Maſſe, but rather maintaine and vphold it as the ſoule and ſtrength of his kingdome. It is the Sacrament which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth by the Maſſe, and not the Maſſe it ſelfe: and this his maintaining the Maſſe, proue h him plainly to be that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt figured by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who tooke away the daily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Synagogue, and ſuborned a falſe worſhip to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Olympius</hi> in ſtead thereof, as theſe haue done the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a peece of bread in ſtead of the true and pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1279:123"/>7. But that we may ſee that the Popiſh perſecution is not leſſe, but farre greater then that of the Heathen Emperours, it will appeare, if we call to mind the bloody executions by moſt exquiſite torments, acted by their Inquiſitors of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prauity as they terme them: For theſe kind of people, are moſt ingenious in deuiſing tortures for poore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they thinke ſcorne that they ſhould be excelled of any Heathen Tyrant in this kind: nay <hi>Phalaris</hi> himſelfe, neuer went beyond them in cruelty, as all know that know their Inquiſition Court: neither is this cruelty proper onely vnto them, but the whole Nation of Papiſts are infected with the ſame ferity: and that they may know themſelues to be the ſlaues of Antichriſt, the more a man is addicted to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the more fierce and bloody minded he is. Our owne Stories do ſhew, how they delight to glut their mindes and eies with beholding the tortures of ſuch as they eſteeme He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, making ſport at their paines. And albeit our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth naturally abhorre all ſpectacles of cruelty; yet I know not how, they that are abandoned to that religion, change this naturall clemency, into vnnaturall immanity. Was euer any cruelty more monſtrous, then to take a young infant deliuered out of it Mothers wombe, and crawling out of the fire wherein the Mother was burning, and to caſt it againe into the flame, there to periſh with the Mother? This we haue had experience of in this Kingdome, as alſo of ranſacking the graues of the dead, and burning their bones as Hereticks, as they did the bones of <hi>Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</hi> Yea ſo fooliſh is their impiety and rage, that they haue come vnto the graue of a dead Chriſtian and digging vp the earth, taken away his winding ſheete, and ſummoned him to appeare at their Courts, as if he had bene aliue: but they themſelues ſhall one day appeare in the high Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, and there receiue the iuſt guerdon of their cruelty May we not then preferre the Pope to the fierceſt Tyrant that euer liued? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, if there were no other argument but their bloody cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt him, conclude, that he is the very Antichriſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1279:124"/> of in the Scripture, whoſe religion breathes nothing but blood, and whoſe deſignements ayme at nothing but Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and whoſe proiects plot nothing but the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all thoſe that will not receiue his marke on their foreheads, and become his ſlaues.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For concluſion of this point, touching Antichriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, obſerue theſe few things. Firſt, that though there was to be vnder Antichriſt, almoſt an vniuerſall defection from the faith; yet his perſecution is not to be vniuerſall, but onely in thoſe places where the Goſpell is entertained. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that this perſecution is not to continue in full ſtrength till the end, but as it grew vp by little and little, ſo it is to decreaſe by degrees; as that Man of Sinne is more and more reuealed, and his power weakned, by the preaching of the Goſpell. Thirdly, that the edge thereof is bent againſt none but Proteſtants: for <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> may liue ſafely with them, euen in <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the Popes noſe, and neuer be called into queſtion for their blaſphemies: onely the poore Proteſtants are ſure to feele the dint of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, of which no other reaſon can be giuen but this, becauſe we ſet our ſelues againſt their errours and pompe: and theſe are open enemies vnto God, to ſhew that their owne glory and credit is more deere vnto them, then the glory of God. Fourthly, that he perſecutes not onely vs whom he calleth his enemies, but alſo his owne friends and followers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocking their ſoules, as he doth our bodies, and leading them blindfolded by troops into hell, and yet no man may dare to ſay vnto him, why doſt thou ſo? Fiftly, that he exerciſeth this cruelty, not onely by iudiciall cenſures, but by open wars, ſetting Kingdomes and Princes together by the eares, and raiſing vp ſubiects in rebellion againſt their Soueraignes: and when <hi>Peters</hi> keyes will not ſerue the turne, to gird himſelfe with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſword, turning the Prieſthood, which ſhould be the Oracle and Sanctuary of peace, into Martiall fury, and the ſword of the Spirit, into a ſword of yron, the force whereof all Chriſtian States haue felt and feared not many yeeres ſince. Sixtly, that when by open violence he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1279:124"/> then he ſeeks by treaſon to effect his will, ſending forth his damned Emiſſaries, Prieſts, and Ieſuites, and ſuch like, to poyſon or ſtab all ſuch as ſtand in their light; not ſparing Emperours, Kings, and Princes themſelues, as Hiſtories do plentifully report vnto vs. And laſtly, that his hatred is not ſo much againſt mens perſons, as againſt their religion and truth it ſelfe, which he labours by all meanes to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate out of the world. But as <hi>Luther</hi> a little before his death, comforting his friends ſaid, ſo ſay I: Let vs be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, though all the Potentates of the world be combined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, yet it ſhall proſper and preuaile in deſpight of them: For, <hi>pro nobis magnus quidam heros ſtat,</hi> a great worthy ſtands on our ſide. And when his friends doubted who this great man ſhould be: He replyed,<note place="margin">Sleidan. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>Is Ieſus Chriſtus eſt quem oportet vincere,</hi> It is Ieſus Chriſt who muſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: who hath already waſted this Man of Sinne, by the breath of his mouth, that is, the preaching of the Goſpell, and ſhall at laſt vtterly deſtroy him by the brightneſſe of his comming. Euen ſo Amen, come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 5.</hi> Touching the continuance of Antichriſts reigne.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ANtichriſt is to be conſidered two waies: either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his perſon, or in reſpect of his reigne. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his perſon, he was borne in the Apoſtles time, and ſhall continue in the world, till the ſecond comming of Chriſt, though with many changes and alterations, as it happeneth to the life of man: where we muſt take the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> not as it is ordinarily vſed in our language, for one certaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, but as the beſt Latine Authors often do, for a certaine title, office, and quality, belonging to one at once, yet to many by ſucceſſion. And thus when we ſay the Pope is Antichriſt, we make all the Popes ſince <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, but one perſon, though they haue bene diuers men in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1279:125"/> ſucceſſion: and for this cauſe it is, that when mention is made of Popes, the ſpeech is in the ſingular number, though that thereby they intend not any one in particular, but the whole order of them in generall: as the Pope is head of the Church, the Pope cannot be an Heretick, the Pope is Chriſts Vicar on earth, &amp;c. Which ſpeeches cannot be vnderſtood of any one ſingular Pope, but of the ſeate and ſucceſſion of the whole order. And thus alſo we ſpeake of Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who at one time are but one in number, yet vary by a perſonall repreſentation, whether by election, or hereditary ſucceſſion; and ſo we ſay, that the King neuer dyes, not the Pope, nor the Emperour, to wit, ſo long as there is a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and continuance in the Kingdome. Now in this ſenſe I ſay, that A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tichriſts continuance in the world, hath bene from the Age of the Apoſtles, and ſhall continue till the laſt day. But if we vnderſtand it of Antichriſts reigne, then the time is of a ſhorter limitation: for as hath bene already ſhewed, that began in <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, and grew to the height in <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, and not long after, began to fade and decline, as we ſee at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Papiſts affirme, that he ſhall reigne iuſt three yeeres and an halfe, and no more; which they ſtriue to proue out of <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25. and 12.7. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.14. where mention is made of time, times, and halfe a time: vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by <hi>time,</hi> a yeere; by <hi>times,</hi> two yeeres; and by <hi>halfe a time,</hi> halfe a yeere. But this interpretation is ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Author himſelfe: onely I will ſhew them how ſenſeleſſe a deuiſe it is, and what difficulties they thereby caſt themſelues into, which are not poſſible to be reconciled. For firſt, to ſay that Antichriſt ſhall reigne but three yeeres and an halfe, and in that ſpace to reduce the whole world into his obedience, is as impoſſible, as if a man ſhould vndertake to trauaile ten thouſand miles in three daies: it is beyond the compaſſe of mans power to atchieue ſuch a conqueſt in ſo ſhort a time, no not if we make him as fortunate as <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captiue, whom they painted ſleeping, and Fortune caſting Cities and Countries into his lap: and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1279:125"/> albeit he be armed with all the power of hell, yet the diuell himſelfe is not able to bring the whole world vnder the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of one man in ſo ſhort a time. Secondly, they ſay, that he muſt reigne ouer the Nation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and that they ſhall receiue him for their Meſſias. But how can this be brought to paſſe within that ſpace?

But <hi>Salomon</hi> was ſeuen yeeres in building it at the firſt, and that with an hundred and fifty thouſand workemen: and for the ſecond reſtauration of it, we heare the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaying vnto Chriſt, ſix &amp; forty yeeres was this Temple in building, &amp; will Antichriſt in three yeeres ſpace ſet it vp anew? Where of ſuch a ſudaine, ſhall he finde workemen, timber, ſtone, and other materials, with inſtruments, and wages? Belike becauſe Chriſt ſaid of his body, deſtroy this Temple, and I will build it againe in three daies, therefore Antichriſt ſhall build againe the materiall Temple in three daies, taking a day for a yeere. Againe, by their doctrine, after Antichriſt hath obtained the Kingdome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he muſt fight with three mighty Kings, of <hi>Aegypt, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and poſſeſſe their Kingdomes: Now theſe Kingdomes are vnder the dominion of two great Emperours, to wit, the Turke, and the Emperour of the <hi>Abaſſines;</hi> and is it probable that they can be ſo ſoone conquered? Surely <hi>Caeſar</hi> was neuer
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1279:126"/> ſo ſpeedy in his victories, when he wrote to the Senate of <hi>Rome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eni, vidi, vici: I came, I ſaw, I ouercame.</hi> He muſt al o ſubdue ſeuen other great Kings, and ſo become the great Monarch of the whole world, and cauſe all Nations to Apoſtate from Chriſt, and entertaine his religion The whole age of a man, is not ſufficient to diſcouer and veiw all the Nations of the world, and yet this monſter muſt quell and tame them in three yeeres, whereas the Romanes ſcarce in ſeuen hundred yeeres could erect their Empire, and that but ouer one part of the world. The Apoſtles of Chriſt, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diuine vertue, and power of miracles, and the gift of tongues, could hardly in twenty yeeres plant Churches in moſt part of the world, and hardly in fiue hundred yeeres was Heatheniſh Idolatry aboliſhed; and ſhall he, as more powerfull then Chriſt, effect as great a worke in three yeeres and an halfe? Further, when they ſay that he ſhall cauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be worſhipped in all places, I wonder what kind of Apoſtles and preachers he ſhall haue, thus to peruert the whole world in an inſtant. Shall men fly about the world on the wings of the windes? and if they do, with what eloquence and Art, ſhall they perſwade both learned, and ſimple, to this defection? What ſhall become then of the Pope, with his Colledge of Cardinals, and whole Romane Cleargy? Shall he finde them ſo light of faith, that they will renounce, not onely their religion (which is no great matter with them) but their State, Pompe, and Authority, vpon ſo ſleight a ſummons?

               <p n="3">3. The Texts out of which they deriue this fancy, are as full of contradiction to their interpretation, as the fancy it ſelfe. For firſt, whereas it is written, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>They ſhall be deliuered into his hand for a time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> In the eight Chapter, it is ſaid: <hi>That he ſhall trample downe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1279:126"/> the Sanctuary,</hi> 2300. daies: both which Texts, are applyed by them vnto Antichriſt. But how can this agree, whereas in one place they finde, three daies and an halfe, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aboue ſix yeeres, for ſo 2300. daies import. Secondly, the time, times, and halfe a time, in the twelfth Chapter, are expounded in the eleuenth verſe, by the number 1290. daies, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth to determine the durance of Antichriſts reigne: but 1290. daies, make three yeeres, and ſeuen moneths, which is a moneth more then three yeeres and an halfe: now if Antichriſt muſt reigne three yeeres and an halfe, or 1260. daies, as they gather out of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps, then he cannot reigne 1290. daies, or if this, then not the former. Thirdly, they ſay, Antichriſt muſt reigne three yeeres and an halfe, and <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> muſt preach againſt him 1260. daies, which make iuſt three yeeres and an halfe, and yet they adde, that theſe two Prophets muſt be ſlaine by Antichriſt, a moneth before his owne deſtruction: but how can th s hang together? If Antichriſts reigne, and <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> preaching, haue one and the ſame ſpace of time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them; how can it then be true, that they ſhall be ſlaine a moneth before his deſtruction? Or if the laſt be true; th n the firſt muſt needes be falſe, that Antichriſt ſhall reigne but three yeeres and an halfe: for here by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is a full moneth after their ſlaughter giuen vnto the life and reigne of this monſter: which difference of time, though it be but ſmall, yet it plainly proueth, that thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> cannot be aſſigned for the preciſe terme of three yeeres and an halfe for Antichriſts reigne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſaith <hi>Remond,</hi>

A ſtrange dreame doubtleſſe, concerning the which, I would demand of them three queſtions. Firſt, what ground of Scripture they haue for this dreame. S. <hi>Paul</hi> indeede, 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.9. ſaith, that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1279:127"/> his comming ſhall be with the efficacy of Sathan, with all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all deceiuable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe: but that he ſhall haue at command the infernall Spirits, and ſend them as his trumpeters through the world, to gather his ſubiects together, is no where to be found in holy Scripture. Secondly, I demand, whether theſe maligne ſpirits, which he ſhall ſend a broad, ſhall be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with aſſumed bodies, or inuiſible as ſpirits? If they ſay inuiſible, how then ſhall they found out this meſſage to their cares, and how can it be but that all men will ſuſpect them for deceiuers, ſeeing they know that the diuell was a lyer from the beginning? Or if viſible like men, how ſhall they be able to perſwade the whole world to Apoſtacy from Chriſt in ſo ſudaine a manner, when as Chriſts owne Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, furniſhed with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, could not conuert the world in a farre longer time? Beſides, appearing as men, they muſt needs be ſuſpected of errour and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, I aske what ſhall become at that time of their great Biſhop, his Cardinals, and the innumerable Armies of Monkes, Friars, Ieſuites, Prieſts, &amp;c. will they all bend their knee at one inſtant to this Idoll, and renounce their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: yea their Pompe, Riches, triple Crowne, red Hats, with all S. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, for the maintenance of which things, they haue ſo laboured and ſtriuen ſo many hundred yeeres? Is this the foundation vpon which their Church is built? Is this their faith, which they ſay the gates of hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preuaile againſt? Is this S. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, which they affirme cannot either erre or faile? When they haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe queſtions, then we will beleeue this dreame.</p>

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1279:127"/> to bring this to paſſe? Beſides, is it likely that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world would bee tempted with Gold to forſake their God, and their Faith, which is more precious then Gold? How many of the very Heathen do we reade of, that haue deſpiſed Gold, and preferred Vertue before it?

Neither is it any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if in this regard we affirme the Pope to bee Antichriſt, ſeeing by riches and worldly honors and preferments hee bindeth vnto himſelfe his followers, eſpecially his Cleargy, whoſe worldly ſtate and pompe is ſo great, as ſcarce any Prince doth goe beyond them: Gold, Honors, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being the very ſinewes of the Popes kingdome.</p>

But becauſe wee muſt not ſeeke for this monſter in any one particular man without relation to ſucceſſion; therefore I ſay ſecondly, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1279:128"/> preſumeth to reigne ſpiritually in the Church beſides Chriſt alone, the true and ſole ſpirituall King thereof, the ſame is Antichriſt ſitting in or ouer the Temple of God. But the Pope by their owne confeſſion hath done this; hee therefore without doubt is that Antichriſt ſpoken of, vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping an vnlawfull tyranny in the Church of God. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> forbids all Paſtors to behaue themſelues as Lords ouer Gods heritage, 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 5.3. and conſequently to reigne ouer them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Out of all which I conclude, that thoſe numbers in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> of 1260 daies, 41 moneths, and three yeeres and an halfe, are not to be taken in a literall, but in a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignification: and that they denote not any certaine or definite time in reſpect of humane vnderſtanding: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that God in his counſaile hath determined a ſet bound to the perſecution of his Church, which cannot bee paſſed; which bound though it be certaine vnto him, yet is vncertaine vnto vs, becauſe it is not for vs to know the times and ſeaſons which the Father hath placed in his owne power. <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.7. And therefore as after foure hundred yeeres compleat, God brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo he will after ſome hundreds of yeeres, deliuer his Church from the cruell and bloody perſecution of all the enimies thereof, and giue it a peaceable and quiet repoſe, as we ſee effected in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great: and to this end ſerues the diuers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of times by yeeres, moneths, and daies, partly that the faithfull might know, that the leaſt moments and minutes of time are determined by God, and partly that they might be ſtrengthned in their miſeries and afflictions, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the ſhortneſſe of them, intimated by ſuch ſhort limitations of time, as of a few yeeres, moneths, and dayes. And beſides, in that all thoſe ſeuerall numbers iumpe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one ſumme of time; for 1260 daies, 42 moneths, and three yeeres and an halfe, are all one in computation; it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainely, that they muſt bee ſpiritually conceiued, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to what end ſhould that variation ſerue?</p>
               <p n="8">8. But howſoeuer they be taken, yet it is cleare, that they
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1279:128"/> cannot be meant of the reigne or perſecution of Antichriſt, but either of the ſtate of the primitiue Church vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors, or of the durance of the Romane Empire fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by the firſt beaſt, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. The firſt of theſe opinions is built vpon this ground, becauſe it is not the maner of holy Scripture to premonſtrate any certaine periods of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine troubles which are raiſed vp in the Church by falſe Chriſtians, but onely of ſuch as ariſe from forraine enemies that profeſſedly hate the truth: as we ſee the perſecution of the ancient Church, vnder the <hi>Aegyptians, Babylonians,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> defined by a certaine number of yeeres by the Prophets: but not that which was inflicted by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Kings, as <hi>Manaſſes, Ieroboam,</hi> and the reſt of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and ſo theſe numbers in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> are not to be referred to Antichriſt who was to be a domeſticall foe, but to the bloody cruelty of thoſe heathen Tyrants. And this is plainely euinced by the number of 42 moneths, which is all one in effect with the other two: for <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.2. it is ſaid, that the Gentiles ſhall tread vnder foot the holy City 42 mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, which I ſee not how it can be well vnderſtood but of the heathen Emperors. And <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.5. it is ſaid of the firſt Beaſt, that power was giuen vnto him to continue 42. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths; now by the firſt Beaſt is ſignified doubtleſſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, which is ſaid to riſe out of Sea, that is, out of warlike tumults; and by the ſecond which ariſeth out of the earth, that is, out of peace and quietneſſe, in a flie and ſubtill maner, the ſtate of Antichriſt. If then this be directly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Romane Empire which is the firſt Beaſt, then it can no wayes appertaine to Antichriſt figured by the ſecond; vnleſſe we will make theſe two Beaſts ſignifie but one and the ſame thing, which is as much, as to make a thing both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after it ſelfe: and that which the holy Ghoſt cals ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet not to be another: and laſtly, the image of a thing, to be the thing it ſelfe. The ſecond opinion touching the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Romane Empire, ſeemeth alſo to haue ſome probability of truth: for the words in the originall, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.5. doe thus ſound, and <hi>Power was giuen vnto him,</hi>

Which interpretation of changing moneths into weekes, though it ſeeme not to accord with the ordinary current of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where daies are put often for yeeres, but neuer moneths for weekes: Yet ſeeing the ſanctity and holineſſe of the man is ſo famouſly knowne, and he ſaith, that he receiued it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reuelation, and the euent anſwereth ſo fitly thereunto; why ſhould it be vtterly reiected?

The ſeuenth day was to them a ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all worldly buſineſſes: the ſeuenth yeere was depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for manumitting ſeruants, releaſing debts, and giuing refreſhment to the tilling of the earth; ſeuen times ſeuenty yeere, was their Iubilee, wherein liberty was reſtored to all bondage, a reſtoring of inheritances, and as it were a reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the world: wherefore ſeeing this Religion of Sabbaths depended in a maner vpon the monethly courſe of the Moone, why ſhould it ſeeme abſurd to referre a moneth

                     </gap>.</hi> 24. But whether that prophecy be already fulfilled, or whether it bee yet to come, is all the doubt. The Papiſts hold, that it is not yet accompliſhed, and thereupon conclude, that Antichriſt is not yet come: but we on the contrary anſwere two things. Firſt, that though it be not yet accompliſhed, yet it doth not therefore follow that Antichriſt is not come. For our Sauiour ſpeaketh not at all of Antichriſt in that whole Chapter, except in generall vnder the name of falſe Prophets but of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of the ſecond comming of Chriſt, which were the two queſtions propounded vnto him by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as he ſate ouer againſt the Temple. The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to wit, touching the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the Temple, he reſolues from the 4. verſe to the 23. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond from the 23. to the 34. and then in the 34. and 35. verſes, he deſignes a certaine time for the firſt, to wit, before that generation ſhould paſſe, that is, the age of the Apoſtles, but leaues the time of the ſecond vncertaine, and therefore exhorts to vigilancy and ſobriety, to the end of the Chapter. And that the 34. verſe is to be vnderſtood of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the 35. of the ſecond comming of Chriſt to iudgement, the Pronownes demonſtratiues there vſed plainely euince. For the Diſciples had asked him thus, <hi>When ſhall theſe things bee,</hi> (that is, theſe things which thou ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt concerning <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and the Temple) and <hi>what ſhall
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1279:130"/> bee the ſigne of thy comming?</hi> Now Chriſt anſwereth, <hi>hac,</hi> theſe things which I ſpake of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſhall bee fulfilled before this generation paſſe: but concerning that day, to wit, of my ſecond comming, <hi>No man knoweth,</hi> &amp;c. So then, if it be granted, that in the 24. and 25. verſes, ther be an implicite prophecy of Antichriſt as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſuppoſeth, yet it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the preaching of the Goſpell through the whole world, cannot be made a ſigne concerning his comming, but either of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> or of the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, which were the queſtions which the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deſired reſolution in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But more probably, wee affirme, that this ſigne was effected before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the Age of the Apoſtles, and by their Miniſtery. For firſt, Chriſt being ready to aſcend into heauen, layde this charge vpon his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that they ſhould goe out into the whole world, and preach the Goſpell to euery Creature: now can wee doubt but they performed what Chriſt had enioyned? This was to accuſe thoſe holy Heraults of want of zeale and diligence in their calling; yea, of manifeſt infidelity and contempt. Or ſhall we imagine, that God reſerued this worke to be brought to paſſe by certaine new Apoſtles, the Diſciples of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldier in this laſt Age of the world, which were to make vp that which was ſailing in the others duty. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to this end and purpoſe Chriſt furniſhed his Apoſtles with the guiſt of tongues, whereby they were enabled to ſpeake all languages without ſtudy, as is apparant, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. Now ſhall we thinke that this gift was giuen them in vaine? And in vaine it had beene doubtleſſe if they had not preached to all Tongues, Languages, and Nations: to what end had beene the faculty of ſpeaking he <hi>Arabian, Scythian, Indian,</hi> tongues, if they had not preached the Goſpell to thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Thirdly, the City of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with the Temple, were ſhadowes and types of the Catholike Church, which was to be diſperſed ouer the whole earth: now the type was not to ceaſe till the body came in full place, and therefore before euerſion of that City and Temple, it was neceſſary, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

Their ſound (to wit, of the Apoſtles) went out (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) into all the earth, and their words vnto the <hi>end of the world.</hi> The like hee affirmeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. where he addeth, that it did not onely come into all the world, but alſo <hi>brought forth fruite,</hi> and therefore it muſt needs bee that it
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1279:131"/> was not onely virtually (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cauilleth) but euen actually in the whole world: for how elſe could it bring forth fruite? Laſtly (which is without all exception) the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the 23. verſe of the ſame Chapter ſaith, <hi>That the Goſpell was then preached to euery creature vnder heauen.</hi> And ſurely reaſon ſheweth the ſame to be poſſible:<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Mat. hom. 76.</note> for as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> well obſerueth, If one <hi>Paul</hi> was able to plant the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in ſo many Countries, as from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Spaine,</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what the other eleuen might do, who were employed in this worke, and diuided the world betwixt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we ſay, that the Goſpell was preached by the Apoſtles in all the world, our meaning is not, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached in euery particular Region of the world, in their owne perſons; ſo that there was no Country, Prouince, or City which they honoured not with their preſence: for this could not poſſibly be in ſo ſhort a time, as twenty, or thirty yeeres, which was the vttermoſt extent of their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Neither yet do we thinke the ſpeech to be meerely Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berbolicall, as if by all the world were meant ſome part of the world. But we ſay confidently, that the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues preached the Goſpell in the moſt famous and generall Countries of the world, and whither themſelues could not penetrate, thither they either ſent their Diſciples in their roomes, or ſome of thoſe new conuerted Chriſtians, in zeale to the faith receiued, went of their owne accords; or at leaſt the fame and eccho of the Goſpell ſpread it ſelfe without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſet teachers, as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expreſſely affirmeth.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. in Rom. cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the preſence of a preacher was wanting, there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and fame of the Goſpell ſounded, as the fame of the miracles in Aegypt ſpread it ſelfe to all Nations,</hi> as witneſſeth <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot.<note place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. 3.</note> And thus (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith) <hi>The ſauing doctrine of the Goſpell, by the vertue and working of God, like a gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sun-beame illuminated the world, and as water being ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a ſtone, leaueth not circling, till the circles come to the bankes, ſo neither was the ſound of the Goſpell ſtaid, till it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the very ends of the world.</hi> Now this is moſt probable, becauſe the Apoſtles by mutuall conſent, or as ſome thinke,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1279:132"/> by lot, diuided the world betwixt them: ſome trauailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Country, and ſome into another: As <hi>Andrew</hi> to the <hi>Scythians, Thomas</hi> to the <hi>Indians, Bartholomew</hi> into <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Mathew</hi> into <hi>Aeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it is alſo to be noted out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in the Homily formerly alledged, that Chriſt doth not ſay, that all the world ſhall beleeue, and receiue the Goſpell, but onely that it ſhall be preached to all the world. So that it can be no good argument to ſay, that ſuch a Nation neuer heard of the Goſpell, becauſe they are not Chriſtians, but Pagans: for it might be preached vnto them, and finde no entertainment; and if it did, yet it might be taken away againe from them for their ingratitude, and they themſelues abandoned by Gods iuſt iudgement to their former Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: as is notorious at this day in many Countries now wholly ſeruing Mahomet, hauing bene before famous for their Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>

But if it be granted, that this vniuerſall promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell, was not effected before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet it doth not follow (ſuppoſing this as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary fore-runner of Antichriſts comming) that he is not yet reuealed.

To which I anſwere two things. Firſt, that it doth not follow, for peraduenture onely the ſame and eccho of Chriſt came vnto their eares, without any ſetled preaching; or if it were preached, yet peraduenture they did not entertaine his doctrine, nor ſubmit themſelues vnto him: either of which might be, and the prophecy fulfilled, that the Goſpell ſhould be preached through the whole world as I haue ſhewed. Secondly, I ſay that in moſt of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries there haue bene found, manifeſt traces of the Chriſtian faith, as may appeare, not onely by thoſe examples ſet downe by this Author, but by diuers others recorded by other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Maffeus</hi> in his fore-alleadged booke,<note place="margin">Maffeus hiſt.

Againe, they haue a picture of twelue men, ſignifying as it may ſeeme the twelue Apoſtles of Chriſt, who the natiues ſay, were Philoſophers excelling in miraculous vertues, and at laſt tranſlated amongſt the Angels.

The learnedſt of them obſerue religiouſly the Lords day, and therein often repeate this prayer: <hi>I worſhip thee, O God, by thy grace and act for euer.</hi> They haue in their writings, the ten commandements of the Law, and tell of a certaine Prophecy, which foretelleth that one day they ſhall all be brought vnder the obedience of one Law.<note place="margin">Nichol.

                  </gap>, by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality or excellency of ſpeech; becauſe though there haue beene many defections from Chriſt cauſed by the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heretikes or Tyrants, yet that which is to bee vnder Antichriſt is by an <hi>Antonomaſie</hi> of ſpeech, called the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: becauſe it is to bee farre greater and more generall then all the reſt. Whence wee may pertinently by the way note fiue things. Firſt, how idle and vaine a queſtion it is which the Papiſts demand of vs vſually: <hi>Where was your Church before Luther?</hi> As if then it tooke the firſt beginning and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1279:136"/> roote in the world. For though it bee eaſie to proue, and hath beene often by the Champions of our Religion, that in all Ages, euen in the darkeſt times of Popery, there hath beene a continuall ſucceſſion of witneſſes to the truth which we profeſſe: yet it is no maruaile that there was then no viſible forme of a reformed Church, ſeeing this Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did preuaile and ouer-flow the world for a long time: which is a ſufficient anſwere to that vaine obiection. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I gather hence, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth erre groſly, in holding that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot erre, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the viſible Church: for if there muſt be by their owne confeſſion an vniuerſall Apoſtacy vnder Antichriſt, then the viſible Romane Church muſt needs bee ſubiect vnto it, or elſe it is not vniuerſall. But as touching the inuiſible Church which is the Congregation of the Elect, knowne onely vnto God, neither can it wholly, nor any one member thereof bee ſeduced by Antichriſt, as is apparent by our Sauiour Chriſts owne ſpeech,<note place="margin">Aug. de ciuit. de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. which is alſo confirmed by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Nunquam à diabolo eccleſia ſiducetur praedeſtinata &amp; electa ante mundi constitutionem,</hi> that is, <hi>The Church predeſtined and elected before the beginning of the world, ſhall neuer be ſeduced by the Deuill.</hi> Thirdly, note that if this Apoſtacy bee of Antichriſt, and thoſe that belong to the body of Antichriſt: then Antichriſt cannot poſſibly bee a Iew by nation and profeſſion, nor his chiefe adherents the Iewes receiue him for their <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For they that neuer made profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, cannot be ſaid to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate from the Faith. Fourthly, note that ſeeing the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Antichriſtianiſme, which is this Apoſtacy heere ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, began to worke in the Apoſtles time; therefore it may well bee concluded, that all thoſe opinions and traditions which are maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to deſcend from antiquity, hauing no ground nor warrant in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are parcels, fragments, and ſymptomes of this Apoſtacy. Laſtly, ſeeing the Antichriſtian Apoſtacy heere ſpoken of, was to continue a long time, and not to be for a few yeeres and daies onely, as thoſe myſticall numbers, <hi>time, times, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1279:136"/> halfe a time,</hi> 1260. daies, and 42. moneths declare: then Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt cannot be one ſingular perſon, as the Papiſts dreame, but a ſucceſſion of perſons in one ſeate, as is by this Author vnanſwerably proued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Papiſts affirme, that the Proteſtants are guilty of this Apoſtacy, and not they, ſeeing it is manifeſt that they haue fallen away, <hi>à Sede Romana</hi> (they be <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words) <hi>The Romane Sea,</hi> and that it cannot be proued that they euer fell away from any Church. But I anſwere three things; Firſt, that it is falſe that we are fallen away from the Romane Sea: we confeſſe that we are fallen off from that Sea, but not fallen away: for we hold ſtill with it, what it holdeth with the truth, as the doctrine of the Trinity, the twelue Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Apoſtles Creed, with the Baptiſme of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Secondly, we diſtinguiſh betwixt Papacy, and Chriſtianity in the Papacy, that is betwixt <hi>Curiam &amp; eccleſiam,</hi> the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or if you will betwixt <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Romanam,</hi> and <hi>Fidem Chriſtianam,</hi> the Roman faith, and the Chriſtian faith, which is hidden in the Romane as a little Gold in a maſſe of Tinne. Now I confeſſe that we are fallen away from the Papacy, that is, the Court and ſuperſtitious doctrines of that Church, but not from the Church, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and Faith thereof. Thirdly, I ſay that we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the holy Ghoſt to come out of <hi>Babylon, Apoc.</hi> 18.4. but <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> as both many of the Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they themſelues confeſſe: to depart then from <hi>Rome</hi> is not to depart from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the Church of Chriſt, but from <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is the Synagogue and kingdome of Antichriſt. May a man for the ſafety of his body flye out of an houſe infected with the plague, and may not wee for the ſafety of our ſoules flye out of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infeſted with moſt peſtilent errors? We were indeed once ioyned in fellowſhip with this Church, vntill God enlightning our eyes by his holy Spirit, we perceiued in what danger wee ſtood, and therefore finding that it was departed from the Goſpell of Chriſt, and had framed to it ſelfe a new Faith and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1279:137"/> Religion out of its owne braine, and in ſtead of Chriſt had entertained Antichriſt, we durſt not be ſo ſenſeleſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, as to pull the eyes out of our heads, and ſtill embrace that Religion, which wee were aſſured would bring vs to damnation. And what if out forefathers were drowned in that ſuperſtition, and liued and dyed in the ſame, ſhould wee follow their examples? And not rather with leauing them to the mercy of God, who might take pitty vpon their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſay with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Chap 16.19. <hi>Surely our Fathers haue inherited lies and vanity wherein there is no profit,</hi> which is a prophecy of the Gentiles conuerted to the faith of Chriſt, both from heatheniſh Idolatry at the firſt, and from Antichriſtian ſuperſtition at the laſt. So that though wee are departed from communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet we can in no reaſon be called Apoſtates from the faith, ſeeing we retaine the ancient Religion taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and profeſſed in the primitiue and purer times of the Church, and reuealed in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. But if wee turne our eyes vpon them, we may eaſily perceiue where this Apoſtacy reſteth; for they are they that are apparently reuolted from the faith: I ſay, from the Faith. Firſt, of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of their owne Church as it was in ancient time. And thirdly, into thoſe errors which are called by the Apoſtle, Doctrines of deuils, and are ſet downe as markes of this Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they are reuolted from the ſaith of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the manifold hereticall doctrines taught and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their Church doe clearely euince; for as it was of old time ſaid of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was <hi>Orbis in vrbe,</hi> a confluence of all Nations; ſo may it be truely ſaid of the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is a confluence and ſinke of all hereſies, which to bee ſo will appeare, if wee take a view of the whole body of their Religion compared with the hereſies of former Ages, and that in order of time, as they ſprung vp in the Church. To begin therefore, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> fixeth vpon the <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naits</hi> as the firſt Heretikes in the Church,<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. <hi>54.</hi>
                  </note> which hereſie
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1279:137"/> though it was vnfruitfull in that time, yet hath beene recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Papacy by their opinion of the carnall eating of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, which at this day they ſo violently defend; for though the error of the <hi>Capernaites</hi> was more groſſe in the circumſtance of eating, yet it was all one in ſubſtance with that which the Papiſts hold. From <hi>Simon</hi> the Magician,<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. <hi>3.</hi> in praeſat.</note> whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calleth <hi>The Father of all Heretikes,</hi> they haue ſucked that peſtilent infection of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpirituall things to ſale for money, which is ſo ordinary a practiſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that their owne writers cry ſhame vpon it with open mouth; and whereas it is a queſtion whether <hi>Peter</hi> were euer at <hi>Rome</hi> or no, it is out of doubt that <hi>Simon</hi> was there, as is in that elegant Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And is not this the very practiſe of the Papiſts in their diſputations, and their conſtant <hi>tenet,</hi> that the Scripture is not ſufficient without traditions; and that the word of God is of two kindes, one written, another vnwritten?

To omit all the reſt of their imputations of Hereſie vnto vs, by theſe few examples vve may iudge, how in hatred to our Religion, they make no conſcience to ſlander it and vs, though neuer ſo palpably fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, according to the old Prouerbiall precept, <hi>Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter, aliquid adhaerebit.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Secondly, as the Church of Rome is thus reuolted from Chriſt, ſo is it from it ſelfe; that is, new Rome vnder Antichriſt, from ancient Rome vnder the firſt Byſhops; and the Church that now is, from the Church that then was, and from the faith that was then profeſſed: ſo that there is no more likeneſſe betwixt them, then is betwixt light &amp; darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let vs take a little view of this change: and firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but that excellent Epiſtle written by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> wherein is comprized the whole faith of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church of Rome. Where is there any the leaſt mention either of the Popes primacy, or of Indulgences, or of the inuocation of Saints, or adoration of Images, or vertue of Reliques, or Monkiſh ſanctity, or Purgatory, or Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, or the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, or Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, with other ſuch like Doctrines, wherein the pyth and ſubſtance of their Religion conſiſteth? Is it likely, that if theſe were Doctrines receiued into that Church, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writing vnto it, would not haue ſo much as ſpoken one word of them? Nay, doe they not directly croſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Apoſtle by many of their Tenets? as by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Iuſtification, by inherent iuſtice contrary to Rom. 1.17. and 4.6. and inuocation of Saints, contrary to Rom. 10.13. and ſatisfactions and merits of condignity, contrary
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1279:141"/> to Rom. 8.18? Inſomuch, that the Rhemiſts are conſtrained to admoniſh their Reader, that <hi>if any thing in Pauls Epistles ſeeme to ſound contrary to the faith of the Catholike</hi> (that is, in their preſumption, the Romane) <hi>Church, hee ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe, that he ſwarueth from the true ſence of the place.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſpeake one thing, &amp; mean another; or auouch one thing in word, and condemne the ſame in ſence: an imputation which none but blaſphemy could lay vpon him. So that whether we reſpect the Apoſtles omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſuperſtitions, or their contradicting of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, it cannot bee denied, but that the face and ſubſtance of their Religion is changed from that it was at that time. Secondly, if we compare the Doctrine of the auncient By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome, with the deciſions of the moderne Popes, and of the Councill of Trent, this will appeare more cleare. For example: <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Eleuther. epiſt. ad Lucium Reg.

But that which me thinkes is moſt ſtrange of all is this, that the Councill of Trent ſpeaking of the Maſſe, ſaith; That it is ſo pure a ſacrifice, that no vnworthineſſe nor wickedneſſe of the offerers can defile it; and therefore, let a Prieſt bee neuer ſo wicked a Fornicator, an inceſtuous perſon, a Sodomite, a periured wretch, yet none of theſe foule crimes doe make him vnfit to ſerue at the Altar, or any wayes impaire the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrifice: onely marriage ordained of God makes them vnfit, and the ſeruice vnprofitable: and ſo ſacerdotall purity ſhall not be polluted by the workes of the deuill, but ſhall be by the ordinance of God. Can any ſpirit but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts breath out this impiety? <hi>Peccata interdixit Deus, non matrimonia</hi> (ſaith <hi>Saluianus:</hi>) that is, God hath forbidden ſinnes, not marriages: but theſe men allow that which God forbids, <hi>ſinnes;</hi> and forbid that which God alloweth, <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> I know their ſcape-hole here is, that they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne marriage ſimply as euill, which <hi>Tatian, Marcion,</hi> and <hi>Manichee</hi> did; and which is it that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but onely reſpectiuely vnto holy Orders. To which I anſwer fiue things: Firſt, that it is impiety to forbid marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in any ſort whatſoeuer, whether abſolutely, or in ſome reſpect, ſeeing that it dependeth not vpon any ordinance of man, but is the gift and vocation of God. Secondly, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh generally againſt thoſe that prohibit marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age without any ſuch diſtinction: and therefore to reſtraine his ſpeech, is to wreſt the Scripture, and to limit the ſence thereof to our owne vnderſtanding, which is an intollerable
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1279:144"/> iniury to the Spirit of God himſelfe, eſpecially there being no other place of Scripture, whereby that diſtinction may be iuſtified. Thirdly, that their diſtinction being admitted, yet they are not thereby cleared from this imputation: for with thoſe fore-named Heretikes, they abſolutely condemne marriage as an impure and vncleane thing.<note place="margin">Bellar. de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis, lib. 1. c. 19</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth this Doctrine in direct words, when he ſayth, That in the coniugall act there is mixed a certaine impurity and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yea in the very Saints themſelues: and therefore Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> and after him Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> to prooue the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of Prieſts marriages alledge theſe texts of Scripture.<note place="margin">Diſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that though they prohibit marriage onely to ſome ſort of people, to wit, the Clergy; yet their reaſon why they do ſo, is, becauſe it is in it ſelfe an vncleane acte. Fourthly, the <hi>Manichees</hi> did not condemne marriage in all, but onely in thoſe whom they called their elect; as the Papiſts alſo do onely to their Prieſts. Laſtly, the horrible fruites not onely of Adulteries and Fornications, but alſo of Sodomiticall abominations and murthers that haue ſprung from this roote of Celebacy (which he that deſireth to take notice of, may reade elſewhere at large diſcouered) doe manifeſtly euince, that it is indeede a Doctrine of diuels, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, and an euident marke of the Apoſtacie of the Church of Rome from the truth.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The ſecond marke of this Apoſtacie, is, the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meates, which God hath created to be receyued with Thankeſgiuing: which marke is moſt expreſſe and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Church of Rome. For it hath forbidden by Law, that which God by Law ordained; to wit, the free vſe of the creatures, reſtraining it by certaine times and differences at their pleaſure, and forbidding ſome at all times, and all at ſome times, to abſtaine from ſome kinde of meates. Their ſhift to auoid this marke, is; That they do not command ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from meats as if they were vncleane of their owne
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1279:144"/> nature, which was the opinion of the <hi>Marcionites, Eucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> but onely in reſpect of religion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, which by ſuch abſtinence is much furthered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. To which I anſwer, that though they neuer ſo much abhorre the Hereſie of theſe forenamed Heretikes; yet they fall into that of <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> who held the ſame opinion of Faſting, that themſelues now do; and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned by the whole Church,<note place="margin">Euſ. hiſt. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. 16.</note> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. For Popiſh Faſtes are preſcribed by publike authoritie and law, and ſo they are no more arbitrarie, but neceſſarie. And <hi>Montanus</hi> Faſts are of the ſame nature, for he was the firſt that preſcribed lawes of Faſting, for which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of the ancient Church, as witneſſe both <hi>Euſebius,</hi>

                  </note> after he had largely diſcourſed of the varieties of the Lent faſt in ſeuerall Churches, hee thus concludes: <hi>It is manifeſt that the Apoſtles permitted free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faſting to euery mans minde and choice, that euerie man might do that which is good, without impulſion by feare or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</hi> But S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is more plaine, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug. epiſt. 86. &amp; cont Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum.

                  <hi>That he found in Scripture that we ought to Faſt, but that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by no precept of the Lord or his Apoſtles, what dayes wee ought, and what we ought not to Faſt.</hi> Secondly, the Papiſtes auow, that meats of themſelues are not vncleane: the ſame did the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi>

Bellar. de bon oper. in part. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> as may appeare out of <hi>Tertullian Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanizing</hi> in his booke of Faſting. Thirdly, the Church of Rome doth not abſolutely prohibit any meate, but onely ſuſpendeth the vſe of ſome for a time. So likewiſe ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in the name of all the <hi>Montaniſts: Wee abſtaine from meats, we do not reiect them, but differ them.</hi> Fourthly, the Church of Rome preſcribes faſting, and the choice of meats, as a ſeruice of God, and a part of his worſhip. So alſo ſaide <hi>Montanus: Our Faſtings are ſeruices of God, and ought to bee performed to God alone.</hi> Laſtly, the Papiſts teach, that by their Faſtings <hi>they appeaſe God, ſatisfie for their ſinnes, obtaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in diſtreſſes, and merit heauen:</hi> And doth not <hi>Montanus</hi> his paraclete ſay the ſame? when he affirmeth, <hi>That Faſting
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1279:145"/> can do much with God, and that God is ſatisfied by it, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne aboliſhed, and our ſaluation re-kindled, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by fulneſſe, yea, that the prerogatiue of it is ſo great, that it maketh God cohabite with man, as like with like.</hi> By all which, it is eaſie to conclude, that the Romiſh Faſts are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from <hi>Montanus,</hi> and that he layed the foundation, and theſe haue reared vp the building of that ſuperſtition. And therefore ſeeing the ancient Church condemned the error of <hi>Montanus</hi> in this point, and the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> defended it by the ſame argument which the Papiſts now do; their opinion and practice being all one in effect, I ſee not how they can cleere themſelues from the ſame cenſure and guilt. Nay, I peremptorily affirme, that they farre exceed the <hi>Montaniſtes</hi> in this ſuperſtition, and that in two reſpects. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Montanus</hi> though he preſcribed lawes of Faſting, yet the penalty of them was onely this; that they accounted the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of thoſe lawes not Heretikes and Apoſtates from the Faith, but onely leſſe holy, and <hi>Pſychici,</hi> that is, carnal men: whereas amongſt the Papiſts, he is eſteemed vncleane and an Heretike, and worſe then any Iew, that eateth fleſh on a Faſting day; wherein, they ſhake hands with <hi>Manichees.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> vndertooke this exerciſe of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,<note place="margin">Aug. con. Fauſt Manich. lib. 30. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>edomandi corporis cauſa, for the taming of fleſhly luſtes,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth; and therefore they abſtained not onely from fleſh, but from Wine, Fruites, many kindes of Fiſh, and all delightfull meates, that might any way pamper or pleaſe the body: but the Popiſh Faſts permit all delicate viands and iunkets, that either Sea or Land can affoord, fleſh onely excepted, as infected with an vncleane ſpirit. They glut themſelues with the moſt exquiſite and rich Wines, with the moſt rare and delicate Fiſhes of all ſorts, with ſawces of rareſt Cookery, with Fruites, Spices, Preſerues, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Broaths, as excellent as the Art of the Apothecary, or of the Kitchin, can affoord. So that one did not without cauſe merrily ſay, That he had rather be a gueſt at their faſts, then at the moſt plentifull feaſts of other men. And thus (forſooth) they ſeeke to tame their fleſh by their Faſting,

The third marke of this reuolt is out of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, chap. 4.3. and that is, to deny Ieſus Chriſt to bee come in the fleſh; which though it hath bene literally verified in diuers Popes that were ranke Atheiſts, and mocke-Gods, as in Pope <hi>Leo</hi> by name, who called the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, a Fable, to Cardinall <hi>Bembus;</hi> and in a number of their Prelates and Prieſts, which haue ordinarily belched out the like Blaſphemies: As of one for example, that hauing preached of the paſſion of Chriſt, ſo paſſionately, that hee made his Auditors to weepe; preſently comforted them with this exhortation: Oh weepe not, for peraduenture this is not true. Yet let that be granted vnto them which they challenge, to wit, that in word they do confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to be come in the fleſh; and then what is that to the clearing of them from this marke? For, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Aug. tract. 6. in epiſt. Iohannis.</note> all the grand Heretikes that euer were in the Church, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe as much; and ſo doth <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his Alcharon, whom diuers Doctrines of the Church of Rome deſigne for the great Antichriſt: and yet who knoweth not, but that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and in effect they deny him, albeit in word they confeſſe him? So likewiſe doth the Church of Rome by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, deny the comming of Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deny the vertue and efficacy of his comming, and the end for which hee came: for to take away the end of a thing, is to take away the thing it ſelfe, and to make it ydle and vaine, which is all one as if it were not. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reaſons when he ſaith, Gal. 2.21. <hi>If righteouſneſſe bee by the Law, Chriſt is dead in vaine,</hi> that is, by conſequent, not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1279:146"/> dead at all, for he could not dye in vaine. And Gal. 5.4. <hi>Chriſt is made of none effect in regard of you that will bee iuſtified by the Law.</hi> How of none effect? but becauſe the end for which he came, is annihilated. Now, what is the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt in the fleſh, but to bee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world, as the name Ieſus importeth, and to bee the King, Prieſt, and Prophet of the Church, as is intimated by the name Chriſt, which is <hi>Nomen officij,</hi> a name impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his office? Now both theſe ends are denied in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore they muſt needs be guilty of denying Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Touching the firſt end, which is to be the Sauiour of the world; doe they not deſtroy that, when they make ſo many Sauiours beſides Chriſt, as the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Saints, to whom in expreſſe words they aſcribe this title of Sauiour, as is to be ſeene in many of their prayers vnto them found in their Breuiaries? and not onely ſo, but alſo make themſelues halfe Sauiours of themſelues, by mixing their owne merits with the merits of Chriſt, and their owne ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions with his, making both together the ioynt cauſe of our ſaluation, which is the preciſe doctrine of the Church of Rome, as their bookes witneſſe: as alſo when they teach, that wee are iuſtified by our owne inherent righteouſneſſe, wrought in vs partly by Gods grace, and partly by our owne free will, which they ſay, is able either to admit or exclude the grace of God comming to conuert vs. Is not this to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt to be Ieſus? For if he be not a Ieſus alone, he is no Ieſus at all. And for the ſecond end, they deny him alſo to be Chriſt: For they make the Pope the head of the Church, and attribute vnto him an infinite and an vnlimited power to rule ouer mens conſciences, to preſcribe Lawes to the Church, to diſpenſe with the Law of God, to be free from error, and to do what he liſt: And thus they rob Chriſt of his Kingly Office, and giue it to the Pope. And for his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, do they not alſo take that from him, by ordaining a new Prieſthood of Popiſh ſhauelings, that haue power to make their Maker, and to offer him vp vnto God, and a new
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1279:146"/> ſacrifice in the Maſſe for the remiſſion of ſinnes, both of the quicke and the dead, and that without ſhedding of bloud, without which the Scripture ſaith plainly, that there is no remiſſion? And do they not intrude the Saints into his Office of Mediation, and euery particular man into his Office of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and dead creatures, as holy Water, holy Lambes, holy Beads, &amp;c. into his Office of purification of ſinnes? And laſtly, touching his Propheticall Office, that they alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him of, by adding to the holy Scripture their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which they make of equall dignity and authoritie with the word of God, by teaching the Scripture to bee an vnperfect rule of it ſelfe, and of no credit without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, yea no better then a noſe of wax, or a rule of lead; by detracting from the Scripture ſome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and appropriating to the Pope the onely key of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thus they deny the ends why Chriſt came in the fleſh, and conſequently deny him to be come.</p>

And touching his reſurrection, they tell vs this pretty tale: That there was a ſtrife in heauen who ſhould go to declare vnto his mother his reſurrection: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſaid, that it belonged vnto him, becauſe as he was the cauſe of euill to the world, ſo he might be the meſſenger of their redemption: but Chriſt anſwered, nay, it may be thou wilt be ſtayed by the way with eating Figs: <hi>Abel</hi> ſaid that it pertained to him; but Chriſt ſaid, nay, for <hi>Cain</hi> may meete thee by the way and kill thee: then <hi>Noah</hi> preſented himſelfe, but Chriſt ſaid, nay, thou mayeſt not, for thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt wine too well, and ſo maieſt forget my meſſage. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt ſaid, I will go, but Chriſt ſaid nay, for thy garment is but of haire: the theefe of the croſſe ſaid, Let me haue this office, but Chriſt ſaid, no in no caſe, for thy legs be broke, and thou maiſt not trauaile ſo long a iourney.

The Sonne ſaid, O Father, I promiſed to ſend to my Apoſtles the Comforter, and now the time is come to fulfill my promiſe: the Father anſwered, I am content, tell the holy Ghoſt: but the holy Ghoſt replied, tell me how they handled thee when thou waſt among them? Then the Sonne ſhewed him his ſide, hands, and feete, pierced and wounded, ſaying; this haue I ſuffered for the loue of mankind; then ſaid the holy Ghoſt, alas for me, but I will go vnto them in ſuch a ſhape, that they ſhall not dare to touch me, and immediately he deſcended with a great ſound from heauen, like the ruſhing of a mighty wind in the ſimilitude of fiery tongues.

                  <hi>Bonauenture</hi> goeth a degree further, and asketh whether it were fit for Chriſt to take fleſh from a man and woman together, or from a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alone: he anſwereth, that doubtleſſe he might haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fleſh from man and woman together, or from man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: which is ſuch a blaſphemy as ouer throweth all the prophecies of Chriſts Incarnation, and indeed his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, in denying an abſolute neceſſity of being borne of a Virgin. But aboue all in impiety, is that execrable queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame Author in the ſame place, and of other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men his followers, to wit; whether it was poſſible that the man Chriſt could ſinne, and ſo not be God: For if he could ſinne (ſay they) he might alſo be damned; and if he might be
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1279:148"/> damned he might alſo not be God. To this they anſwer, that the humane ſoule of Chriſt is to be conſidered, <hi>either as vnited to the Word, or as ſeparated and not vnited:</hi> Now it is without queſtion (ſay they) that this ſame ſoule if it were not vnited might ſinne, which being vnited could not ſinne: As if (prophane wretches as they are) the ſoule of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, could be not vnited in any conſideration whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, or that it is not blaſphemy to haue ſuch a thought: nay, the ſame Author concludeth peremptorily, that if we regard the power of free-will in Chriſt in this ſenſe, as the power by which a man ſinneth, Chriſt might haue ſinned, and ſo might be damned, and not be God. O blaſphemies intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable! my heart quaketh to thinke of them, and my hand and pen to write them: neither would I in reuerence to my Sauiour Chriſt dare to mention them, were it not to diſcouer the abhominations of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to ſhew that howſoeuer in word they confeſſe Chriſt, yet in effect and truth they deny him, by calling the efficacy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into doubt by ſuch prophane queſtions.</p>

Adde hereunto, that it is
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1279:149"/> the common opinion of all their Doctors, that Chriſt from the very firſt moment of his conception, was a <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that is, in the ſtate of that bleſſedneſſe which is future to vs after this life: but by their owne doctrine, <hi>a Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is not in the ſtate of meriting,</hi> and ſo it will follow, that Chriſt by his comming in the fleſh hath merited nothing, and conſequently that his comming was in vaine, and ſo indeed as if it were not.

               <p n="1">1. THe title of Chriſts Vicar vpon earth, agreeth well vnto the name and nature of Antichriſt: for the name Antichriſt, ſignifieth not onely an oppoſite, but alſo a ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute vnto Chriſt, as hath bene declared before: to ſignifie that Antichriſt ſhould be in name and pretence a friend vnto Chriſt, but indeed an enemy, and therefore an hypocrite, hauing hornes like a Lambe, but ſpeaking like the Dragon. And it muſt needs be ſo: for firſt, where mention is made in holy Scripture of the Antichriſtian Apoſtacy, there is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the hypocriſie of the Apoſtates, as 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2. where the Authors of the Apoſtacy are ſaid to ſpeake lyes through hypocriſie: So 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.3. and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3.7. calleth Antichriſtianiſme not onely an Apoſtacy, but alſo a myſtery of iniquity: which he would neuer haue done, if Antichriſt ſhould haue bene a profeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy vnto Chriſt. Secondly, to oppugne Chriſt by open force, and to ſeeke to roote out the Chriſtian name, is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to all thoſe conditions whereby Antichriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the holy Ghoſt: as that he ſhould be a teacher of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1279:149"/> lyes through hypocriſie, and that he ſhould ſit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that is, the Church, that his impiety is myſticall, that is, palliated with the name of piety, as their owne gloſſe ſpeaketh on 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and that the cup wherewith the Whore of Babylon doth make drunke the inhabitants of the earth, is of gold, faire and ſpecious to ſight, and the liquor in it wine, which is pleaſant to taſt; but vnder both, lyeth and is mixed moſt deadly poyſon: all which doth plainly ſhew that Antichriſt cannot be an open Aduerſary. And laſtly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his very drift and ayme is, to ſeduce and deceiue the world, for which cauſe he is ſaid to come with the efficacy of deceite; it is not likely that he ſhould be ſo ſimple as to profeſſe himſelfe Chriſts enemy in plaine words, for who would not then beware of him? So that as it is vſuall with a Traytor to pretend the name and authority of the King to draw the ſubiects to his part: ſo doth Antichriſt, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Chriſts name and authority, draw the world into manifeſt rebellion againſt Chriſt. Now the Pope doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declare himſelfe to be Antichriſt, as by other markes and qualities, ſo eſpecially by this, in that he aſſumeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the title of the Vicar of Chriſt, and vnder that colour ſecretly oppoſeth Chriſt and his Church. For, I pray you, what meaneth this title but one of theſe two things, to wit, either that Chriſt hath diſcharged himſelfe of his office, and committed it to another; or that he hath need of a Vicar to ſupply his roome, himſelfe being vnſufficient thereunto? And if they ſay that it is neither through negligence, nor impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, but rather as a meanes which he hath ordained by his prouidence to gouerne his Church on earth: I would then aske them, where is this commiſſion, and when was this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority giuen vnto him? Sure it cannot be, being a matter of ſo great a moment, but it muſt be expreſſed in wortis: eſpecially ſeeing the Spirit of God is the great and generall Vicar of Chriſt on earth, and the Miniſters are appointed as the meanes to bring men to heauen, and Kings and Princes are in their dominions his Vicegerents and Lieutenants, for the outward gouernment of the Church. And indeed if we
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1279:150"/> conſider a little neerely the Offices of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to wit, his Prophecy, Prieſthood, and Regality, we ſhall finde, that this vſurping Vicar hath rauiſhed them all into his hands, and depriued Chriſt thereof, as ſhall appeare in the diſcourſe following.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Propheticall Office of Chriſt, is taken from him by the Pope many waies, eſpecially by theſe doctrines that follow: Namely, that the holy Scripture is inſufficient and vnperfect of it ſelfe, and that this imperfection muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the helpe of traditions: for the Pope ſcorning to be encloſed within the bands of holy Scripture, hath taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe authority to adde thereunto what he pleaſeth, to cut off what he lifteth, to change it into what faſhion he will, and to interpret it at his pleaſure. In ſuch ſort, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he either forbiddeth,<note place="margin">Benedict de Benedict. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at an Antith. ont.

Now it is to be noted, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the decree of the Councill, and the ordinance of Pope <hi>Sixtus;</hi> yet <hi>Clement</hi> the ninth in the yeere 1592. in the firſt of his Pontificy, cauſed the ſame to bee reprinted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the Vaticane after another edition, giuing vnto it the ſame authority, which <hi>Sixtus</hi> had done vnto his: where we may behold a Pope oppoſed to a Pope, a Pope that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, to a Pope that cannot erre: and yet they contradict and enterferre with each other after a ſtrange manner: for that which <hi>Sixtus</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Clement</hi> denyeth; that which <hi>Clement</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Sixtus</hi> denyeth; the one breatheth hot, the other cold; the one the truth, the other falſhood; the one diminiſheth, the other augmenteth; and in a word, diſplay to the world a ſpectacle of groſſe and ridiculous contradictions of Romane Popes. A full view whereof, he that is deſirous to take, let him read an entire booke of our Countryman Doctor <hi>Iames,</hi> about this ſubiect. Now iudge,<note place="margin">Bellum papale. Tho.

For if the one could iudge that the other had erred in many places, why might he not alſo erre in many others vnobſerued? And if this might happen to one Pope, why may it not be ſuſpected of another?

But to paſſe from this, and omit many other doctrines of theirs, which are flat oppoſite to the Propheticall Office of Chriſt; I conclude with a moſt audacious and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practiſe tending to the ſame, and namely, a peremptory decree, that all the ordinances of the Apoſtolike (that is Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) Sea, muſt be receiued as if they were confirmed by the diuine voyce of S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">Diſt. 19. cap. ſic omnes.</note> and that what Kings, or Biſhops, or Potentates ſoeuer, ſhall violate or ſuffer to be violated, the decrees of the Romane Biſhops, ſhall incurre the execreable <hi>Anathema,</hi> as a preuaricator of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith.

So the Biſhops of the Soueraigne ſeate, giue reuerence to the Canons, made either by themſelues, or by others vnder their authority, and in humility obſerue them for example ſake vnto others: yet neuertheleſſe ſometimes, either by commanding, or decreeing, abrogating, or altering, they ſhew themſelues, <hi>Lords of the Decrees and Canons:</hi> thus he. By which we may ſee, how the Pope vſurpeth the very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power of Chriſt himſelfe, to wit, not to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to his owne Lawes, but to be the onely abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Maſter, and Teacher of the world: to teach all, and not to be taught of any; to giue Lawes to all, and not to take Lawes from any; to iudge all, and not to be iudged of any; and laſtly, not to erre, as all others may doe beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>

Touching his Kingly Office, doe they not in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rauiſh that from him, when they aſſume to themſelues thoſe very titles, and that ſame power which appertaineth vnto Chriſt? It is a Decree of a Councill held at <hi>Rome</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, in the yeere 1057. <hi>That there is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1279:151"/> but one name in the vvorld, to wit, of the Pope, and that this name ought onely to bee named in the Churches.</hi> What is this but to rob Chriſt of that honour which the Scripture aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and appropriateth onely to his name, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Pope intitleth himſelfe the Head and Husband of the Church, both which are the proper titles of our Sauiour Chriſt by their owne confeſſion: what then? will they make the Church a monſter with two heads, and an adultereſſe with two huſbands? For Chriſt muſt be one head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the Pope will be another, and ſo there muſt be two of each: which howſoeuer it may bee borne withall in the title <hi>[Head,]</hi> yet it cannot be in endured the title <hi>[Husband:]</hi> for iealouſie will not ſuffer an husband to admit of a Vicar or ſubſtitute in his office of an husband; it cannot abide that the wiues loue ſhould be wooed, much more drawn away by another: and therefore it is moſt abſurd to dreame of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall husband, as they doe of a miniſteriall head. The Pope can in no ſenſe be the husband of the Church, but in that he wooeth the Church, which is Chriſts ſpouſe, from her owne husband to himſelfe, muſt needs be an Adulterer and not a husband. As for the title <hi>[Head,]</hi> I confeſſe that one may be ſaid to haue diuers <hi>heads</hi> in different reſpects, but not of the ſame order and kinde: for beſide the the naturall head which euery man hath, he hath alſo a ſpirituall head which is God, and a politicke head which is the ſoueraigne Magiſtrate: but there is nothing in the world that can haue two heads of the ſame reſpect and ranke, but is a monſter; and ſo is the Church, if it haue both Chriſt and the Pope: for their headſhip is of one and the ſame kinde, to wit, ſpirituall as cannot be denyed. I know their euaſion, which is, that Chriſt is the principall head of the Church, and the Pope onely the miniſteriall: but this is an idle and vaine diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for beſides that, it hath no foundation in holy Scripture, I demand, in what reſpect is the Pope the miniſteriall head? Sure it muſt needs bee either in reſpect of Chriſt, or of the Church: but in reſpect of the Church it cannot be, becauſe to be the miniſteriall head in reſpect of the Church, is to ſerue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1279:152"/> the Church, now to ſerue and yet to be the head, are things ſo oppoſite, that they can no more agree together, then in the body to be a member, and to be the head: for the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of a head is not to ſerue and miniſter, but to command and gouerne: ſo that if the Pope be the head of the Church, he cannot be the miniſter of the Church, and if he be the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, he cannot be the head. Neither can he bee ſo called in reſpect of Chriſt, becauſe then it would follow, that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the roome and place of Chriſt, he ſhould be a head of the ſame kinde and order, and conſequently the Church ſhould haue two heads, and ſo be a monſter. As therefore he that ſhould challenge himſelfe to bee a miniſteriall huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to another mans wife, is no better then an Adulterer: ſo the Pope challenging to be the miniſteriall head of the Church, is no better then an vſurper. And that we may bee fully reſolued in this point, obſerue laſtly how they attribute to the Pope, and the Pope to himſelfe, all that euer apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Kingdome of Chriſt.

               <p n="4">4. The Prieſthood of Chriſt remaineth, which is after the order of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> and hath two parts, to wit, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of our ſinnes by an offering of himſelfe on the Croſſe once for euer, whereby he ſatisfied the diuine iuſtice for the ſinnes of all the Elect: and his Interceſſion, whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered from our ſinnes by his ſatisfaction, are made partakers of eternall ſaluation: which two actes as they are inſeparably ioyned together, and haue mutuall dependancy vpon each other; ſo they are vncommunicable to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vnimitable by any. Howbeit this ſacred Office with both the parts thereof is taken from Chriſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and imparted to other things: As firſt, when they deuiſe another Prieſthood, Altar, and Sacrifice, different from thoſe of Ieſus Chriſt, making the world beleeue, that Chriſt is offered euery day, and in all places, in the Maſſe, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of remiſſion of ſinnes, for the liuing and the dead, contrary to the expreſſe Text of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. and 10.10.11.12. and that oftentimes by the hands of a mortall man ſoyled with abominable vices: and in ſtead of Chriſt, offering a peece of bread, to the which they render Diuine honours, as if it were Chriſt himſelfe, by an execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry: and inſtead of the Croſſe, ſubſtituting an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of ſtone after a Iewiſh and heatheniſh manner: as if <hi>Melchizedek</hi> was not a type of Chriſts Prieſthood, who notwithſtanding repreſented Chriſt in theſe particulars. Firſt, in that he was both a Prieſt and King together. Secondly, without Father, Mother, or diſcent, hauing neither beginning of daies, nor end of life. And thirdly, in that his Prieſthood was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that is, (as the word ſignifieth) vnpaſſable to any other ſucceſſor or Vicar whatſoeuer. For we muſt note, that as <hi>Melchizedek</hi> is brought in by <hi>Moſes</hi> as a man fallen from heauen, not declaring either his Father, Mother, or race, not ſucceeding in office to any that went before, not reſigning the ſame to any ſucceſſor or Vicar; ſo our Lord
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1279:153"/> Ieſus Chriſt as hee had no predeceſſor in the office of his Prieſthood, ſo he cannot haue any ſucceſſor or Vicar: but as he alone was deſigned by the Father to this office, ſo he alone without any helper, exerciſed the ſame heere on earth, and ſtill exerciſeth it in heauen by his interceſſion for ſinners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes liuing, to the end that by the vertue and force of his Prieſthood and ſacrifice, he might to the full, or to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ſaue ſuch as come vnto God by him, as is at large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in the ſeuenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, quite contrary the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, that the Pope with all his Biſhops and Prieſts, are Sacrificers after the order of <hi>Melchizedek:</hi> which if it bee true, how is Chriſts Prieſthood <gap reason="foreign">

And how is Chriſt onely a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> if he haue for his companions in office ſo many thouſand of Popiſh ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? And if the oblation made once by Chriſt on the Croſſe be reiterated euery day in the Maſſe, how can it bee, but that Chriſts ſacrifice was imperfect, ſeeing it ſtood in need of iteration, as the Apoſtle concludeth of the legall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in this regard, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27? But not content herewith, they ioyne alſo the ſufferings of the Saints, with this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, for the ſatisfaction and expiation of our ſinnes. For they ſay, that the Apoſtles, Martyrs, and other Saints, haue for the loue they bare to God, done more good and ſuffered more euill, then was needfull for the expiation of their owne ſinnes before God, and for the meriting of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: So that of their ſuperabounding merits and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, ioyned with thoſe of Chriſt, is compoſed that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed treaſure of the Church, which the Pope diſpenſeth to the world by his Indulgences: yea, they proceede ſo farre, as to make euery Chriſtian a ſatisfier for himſelfe and his owne ſinnes, by the merit of his good workes, as Faſting, Almes, and other workes of Penance.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of theſe foure doctrines is, That Antichriſt ſhall deny Ieſus to bee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently aboliſh the Sacraments of Chriſt, and bring in againe the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath and Ceremonies. For (ſaith he) Antichriſt muſt bee a Iew by Nation and Religion, and receiued of the Iewes for their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and therefore muſt openly oppoſe himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. And beſides Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that hee that denyeth Ieſus to bee Chriſt, is the ſpirit of Antichriſt. To which I anſwere, that firſt hee ſetteth downe that for certaine, which is in queſtion. For wee peremptorily deny, that Antichriſt ſhall be a Iew, either by Nation, or Religion, or receiued of the Iewes for their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as is euidently proued by the Author of this Treatiſe, where hee anſwereth all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are brought to the contrary. Secondly wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that Antichriſt ſhall deny Ieſus to bee Chriſt, and ſo doth the Pope. For though hee acknowledge the name of Chriſt in appearance, yet hee taketh from it all the vertue and efficacy thereof, as hath beene proued before, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſt by word, but denyeth him in effect: for it is certaine, that Chriſt may be denyed two waies; either ouert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or couertly, that is, either in word, or in effect: thus the deuill in many places of the Goſpell, confeſſeth that Ieſus is the Chriſt, and the holy one of God; and yet doth he not by might and maine oppugne this doctrine, and in effect deny it? S <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore well expreſſeth what Antichriſt ſhall
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1279:155"/> doe, but he doth not expreſſe the manner how he ſhall doe it: and therefore this is a ſophiſticall concluſion, to argue from the ſubſtance of a thing, to the manner of doing it. For things may be denied, either directly or indirectly, either by expreſſe maximes, or by neceſſary conſequences; and this latter is therefore more dangerous, becauſe it is more deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. We do not read that <hi>Epicurus</hi> denied this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>There is a God:</hi> but when he framed to himſelfe ſuch a God that had no care nor prouidence ouer the world, did he not indirectly deny there was a God? For God cannot be without a prouidence. So the Pope doth not in direct words deny this propoſition, <hi>Ieſus is Chriſt:</hi> yet when he giueth vnto him a phantaſticall body by his doctrine of tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, robbeth him of all his offices, and ioyneth others with him in the worke of Redemption, what doth he but by conſequent deny him to be Chriſt? Yea but (ſaith he) all Heretikes thus deny Chriſt, therefore Antichriſt muſt deny him after another ſort; to wit, ſimply and abſolutely. But ſay I, the cleane contrary doth rather from hence follow: For S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth manifeſtly affirme, that the ſpirit of Antichriſt, is the ſame with that of former Heretickes, when he ſaith; <hi>Such is the ſpirit of Antichriſt, of which ye haue heard ſay, that he ſhall come, and now is already in the world.</hi> Now if Antichriſt muſt ſpeake by the ſame ſpirit that Heretikes did, then he muſt alſo deny Ieſus Chriſt after the ſame manner, to wit, not by denying his name, but by deſtroying his faith; and thus this firſt doctrine agreeth fitly to the Pope, if we vnderſtand S. <hi>Iohn</hi> as he ought to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their ſecond doctrine of Antichriſt is, that he ſhall name himſelfe not the Vicar or ſeruant of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelfe, and this, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.43. <hi>If an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhall come in his owne name, him will ye receiue.</hi> Where it ſeemeth (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) that Chriſt expreſſely vſeth theſe words: <hi>In nomine ſuo,</hi> In his owne name,<note place="margin">Bel. de Rom. Pont. lib. 3. cap. 14.</note> fore-ſeeing that the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> would ſay, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould not come in his owne name, but in the name of Chriſt, as his Vicar. But what a vaine interpretation this is,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1279:156"/> may appeare by two reaſons out of their owne <hi>Maldonate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Maldon in Ioh. 5.43.</note> Firſt, that Chriſt ſpeaketh not here in particular of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but in generall of all falſe Prophets, by the word, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;</hi> not defining one particular perſon, but deſigning any one whatſoeuer, that ſhall come in his owne name. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that by, <hi>In his owne name,</hi> he meaneth not, that hee ſhall take vpon him the name of Chriſt, but that he ſhall come of his owne priuate authority, without being ſent of God. For albeit diuers amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> both about Chriſts time, and after, tooke vpon them falſly the name of the Meſſias, of whom Chriſt foretelleth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.3.33. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceiue many:</hi> neuertheleſſe he here prophecieth of many that ſhall come in their owne name, that is, not being ſent of God, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Ier, 23.21.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue not ſent theſe Prophets, ſaith the Lord, and yet they ran: I haue not ſpoken to them, and yet they prophecied.</hi> So that to come in a mans owne name, is nothing elſe, but to come without miſſion or commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God. Howbeit we deny not, but that Antichriſt ſhall ſeate himſelfe in the place of Chriſt, and in ſome ſort en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title himſelfe by the name of Chriſt, and aſſume vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all the honour and reuerence which is due vnto Chriſt; all which ſeeing it is apparent that the Pope doth, we may therefore in this regard alſo conclude him to be Antichriſt. For firſt, all the paſſages of holy Scripture which are directly intended of Chriſt, he referreth to himſelfe, as hath bene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proued. Secondly, he aſſumeth alſo the proper titles of Chriſt, as to bee the Head and Husband of the Church, the High-Prieſt of the new Couenant, the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Biſhop of the world, the great and vniuerſall Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the Flocke, and in a word the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and the roote of <hi>Dauid,</hi> with other ſuch like. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laſtly, he forbeareth not to ſtile himſelfe by the very name Chriſt, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, <hi>alias Hildebrand</hi> doth, both in an Epiſtle to <hi>Lanfranke</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and alſo in a Councill held at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. In both which, he applieth to himſelfe that ſpeech

                  <hi>and the Princes aſſembled againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt,</hi> which S. <hi>Peter, Acts.</hi> 4.26. interpreteth as ſpoken directly of Chriſt and none other. In the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, the holy Ghoſt applyeth vnto Chriſt, theſe words of the eight <hi>Pſalme: Thou haſt made him a little inferiour to the Angels,</hi> to wit, in regard of his paſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and yet this very ſame is the deuice or motto of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift of late memory, in all the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and pourtraicts that were made of him. What ſhould I ſpeake of their blaſphemous application of the reſt of that <hi>Pſalme?</hi> as where it is ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt put all things vnder his feete,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Popes</hi> feete: <hi>Sheepe,</hi> that is, the ſoules of the faithfull Chriſtians: <hi>Oxen,</hi> that is, <hi>Iewes</hi> vnder the yoke of the Law: <hi>Beaſts of the field,</hi> that is, Pagans wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the broad way to hell: <hi>Fowles of the aire,</hi> that is, Saints departed and in bliſſe: and laſtly, <hi>Fiſhes of the Sea,</hi> that is, ſoules tormented in Purgatory. The Pope is made Lord of all theſe, and what can Chriſt haue more? Nay,<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pont. lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> highly commendeth S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> for giuing theſe high titles to Pope <hi>Eugenius: Thou art the great Prieſt, the Soueraigne Biſhop, the Prince of Biſhops, the Heire of the Apoſtles, thou art Abel in Primacy, in Gouernment Noah, in Patriarchacy Abraham, in Order Melchizedek, in Dignity Aaron, in Authority Moſes, in Iudgement Samuel, in Power Peter, &amp; in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction Chriſt.</hi> Here the very name <hi>Chriſt</hi> is giuen by S. <hi>Bernard</hi> to Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> accepted of him as his owne, and allowed of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as due vnto him: and what can Antichriſt do more? But that we may ſee the very height of their blaſphemy in this kinde, I cannot paſſe ouer in ſilence one example more: It is this. After the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Veſpers, wherein ſo many hundred Frenchmen were maſſacred at once, in the yeere 1282. thoſe of <hi>Palerma</hi> ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth, for abſolution from that bloody act: who caſting themſelues at his feete, and ſaluting him as if he were Chriſt, made this ſupplication vnto him: <hi>Thou that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world haue mercy on vs:</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1279:157"/> and againe, <hi>Thou that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world haue pitty on vs:</hi> and the third time, <hi>Thou that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, giue vs thy peace:</hi> which the Pope was ſo farre from reiecting as blaſphemous, that he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely thus to anſwer, that the <hi>Palermans</hi> imitated thoſe that ſmote Chriſt, ſaluting him by the name of the King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and yet in effect being enemies vnto him, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his blood. Now then, if their owne maxime be true, the Pope is without all doubt Antichriſt; for he both ſtileth himſelfe, and ſuffereth himſelfe to be called of others by the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The third doctrine, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſcribeth as proper vnto Antichriſt, is, that he ſhall vſurpe the name and title of God, and not onely his power and authority, and ſo ſhall call himſelfe God, and be worſhipped as God: and this he groundeth vpon 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. where it is ſaid, <hi>That he ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, as if he were God.</hi> But by his leaue, S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay that he ſhall call himſelfe God, but that he ſhall carry himſelfe as God in the Temple, that is, in the Church of God: and what is that, but to vſurpe the power and authority of God? This is therefore an abſurd concluſion, grounded vpon a falſe interpretation of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words. It is ſufficient then, to proue the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt by this marke, if I ſhew that he vſurpeth the power and authority of God in the Church, and putteth on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine properties. And this he doth many waies: as firſt, it is an eſſentiall propertie belonging vnto God, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priuiledge, not to be ſubiect to errour: for though the Prophets and Apoſtles in their Sermons and writings, did not erre, becauſe they were immediatly inſpired and directed by the Spirit of truth; yet ſeeing that immediate inſpiration is not now to be found in the Church, vnleſſe by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſianiſme of the Anabaptiſts, therefore no man liuing can challenge to himſelfe ſuch a power. But the Pope doth this, and thereby demonſtrateth himſelfe euidently to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: and yet this maxime, <hi>That the Pope cannot erre,</hi> is one of the principall engines which Sathan hath deuiſed to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1279:157"/> vphold the kingdome of errour. I know what they anſwere when we obiect vnto them the examples of many Popes that haue erred; namely, by ſtrange diſtinctions, as, that he may erre as a particular perſon and Doctor, but not as Pope: or thus, Not when he determineth <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> out of his Chaire, for the inſtruction of the whole world, but only when he propoundeth and deliuereth his priuate opinions by word or writing. But who ſeeth not the abſurdity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tion of this diſtinction? For the Pope is alwaies a publike perſon and Doctor of the Church, and not a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>; ſo that theſe are contradictory propoſitions, to be Pope, and yet to be a particular Doctor; as to bee a Soueraigne King, and a priuate perſon. And therefore if <hi>Catharinus</hi> had reaſon to mocke at <hi>Caietane,</hi> who writing of <hi>Herods</hi> ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the demand of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts head, diſtinguiſhed betwixt the King and <hi>Herod,</hi> as if it was the King that was ſad, and not <hi>Herod:</hi> for (ſaith <hi>Catharine</hi>) if the King was ſad, and <hi>Herod</hi> was the King, then by my Logick, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>Herod</hi> was alſo ſad; and if <hi>Herod</hi> would ſlay <hi>Iohn,</hi> then the King would ſlay him; &amp; if the King ſeemed vnwilling to haue it done, then <hi>Herod</hi> did the like. And haue not we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reduce to the rules of the ſame Logick, thoſe that ſay, that <hi>Clement</hi> may erre, as <hi>Clement;</hi> that is, as a priuate man: but not as Pope, that is, a publike perſon? For as <hi>Herod</hi> is King, ſo is <hi>Clement</hi> Pope. This is as if a man ſhould ſay, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was ignorant as a man, but wiſe as a Philoſopher; and ſo he ſhould be called a wiſe Philoſopher, and an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man. But let this abſurd diſtinction be allowed, yet it will helpe them nothing; for many Popes haue erred as Popes, out of their Chaire in their publike Decrees and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reaſoneth. <hi>De Rom. Pontif. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. Whereunto I anſwere two things. Firſt, that the Pope exalteth himſelfe apparently aboue, not onely all that is called God, that is, to whom the name of God is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, but euen God himſelfe, not openly and in word, (for what followers and Diſciples could hee then haue in ſuch a foule and groſſe oſtentation?) but indeed and fact, like <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that kiſſed Chriſt with his mouth, but betrayed him by his practiſe to the Iewes. Now that the Pope doth thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himſelfe, is ſo apparent, that none that hath any relike of vnderſtanding can doubt thereof.

And for the other Sacrament of the Lords Supper they take away the Cup from Laicks; which when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by many Princes and States to be reſtored againe in the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Councill referred them heerein to the diſcretion of the Pope, thereby attributing vnto him full power ouer the diuine Sacraments. In breefe, to cut ſhort, doe wee not ſee by experience, that the Pope and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe more ſeuerely puniſh ſuch as tranſgreſſe his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Traditions, then thoſe that trample vnder their feet the Commandements of God? For, to eate fleſh in Lent, is with them a greater ſinne, then to ſteale, or commit adultery: and who knoweth not, that a Prieſt ſhall be more rigorouſly handled, if he ioyne himſelfe to one onely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in holy marriage, then if he keepe openly many Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines and Harlots, or defile other mens wiues, or haunt the Stewes? And thus the Pope exalteth himſelfe aboue all that is called God, yea aboue God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Secondly, I anſwere, that it is no where found in Scripture, that Antichriſt ſhall ſuffer no God to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, whether true or falſe, nor any Idols; nay rather his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry doth proue him to bee Antichriſt.

In which words, we may obſerue fiue things. Firſt, that Antichriſt ſhall come, armed with the power of Sathan. Secondly, that by his power he ſhall deceiue the world. Thirdly, that the reaſon why the world ſhall be deceiued by him, is, becauſe God ſhall ſend vpon them ſtrong deluſion, euen ſo ſtrong, as to beleeue a lye. Fourthly, that the chiefe meanes whereby he ſhall deceiue, is by lying ſignes and wonders. And laſtly, that they onely ſhall be deceiued by him, that are ordained to periſh, who receiued not the loue of the truth that they might be ſaued? Now that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanicall deluſion of the world is euidently verified in the Papacy, is ſo manifeſt, that none that hath but the leaſt ſparke of reaſon can doubt thereof: and alſo that this delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is effected, as by one ſpeciall meanes, by lying ſignes and wonders.

Their Monaſteries, their Cloiſters, their Chappels, their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, proclaime euery where this deluſion: The Legends of their Saints and ſuch like bookes, whereunto moſt men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore gaue as much credit as to the word of God it ſelfe, are ſo prodigiouſly ſtuffed with this traſh, that the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them would aſtoniſh any in whoſe heart there is but the leaſt taſte of piety. Read the conformities of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the Hiſtory of the Archbiſhop <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the flowers of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the Golden Legend of <hi>Iames De Voragine,</hi> the booke of the miracles of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Dialogues of <hi>Ceſarius,</hi> the Annales of <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Hiſtory of our Lady of <hi>Halls</hi> written by <hi>Lipſius,</hi> the Sermons of <hi>Dormi ſecure,</hi> with a number other ſuch like; and you ſhall finde neither bancke nor bottome of this foppery: neither mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, meaſure, nor end, of miracles: Yea, how Sathan hath bewitched their hearts, to beleeue that which is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and to imagine they ſee that which they ſee not, nor can be ſeene. And by this marke (forſooth) they would proue the true Church to be with them, and no where elſe; and challenge vs to proue our religion and miſſion by miracles; which becauſe we cannot do, they therefore triumph ouer vs as Heretikes and Schiſmatikes from the true Church: whereas indeed their vaunt of miracles, doth proue them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Synagogue of Antichriſt, and our want of them, doth clearly deliuer vs from that ſuſpition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For we are to obſerue here three things in generall, before we come to the particular conſideration of this point. Firſt, that miracles were ordained of God for the ignorant, and ſuch as had not receiued the faith of Chriſt, and that in the prime daies of the Church, when the new and ſtrange doctrine of the Goſpell began firſt to be preached, to the end that they which by reaſon of the ſeeming contrariety of Chriſtian religion, to the principles of humane reaſon, would
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1279:164"/> not be perſwaded with words, might by beholding ſtrange workes, exceeding the power of nature, wrought by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, be enclined to the entertainement of their doctrine: and ſo there was a neceſſary vſe of miracles, in the infancy of the Church; that thereby vnbeleeuers might be conuerted to the faith. But after the world had receiued the doctrine of the Goſpell, and profeſſed the faith which was before ſo ſtrongly confirmed, there was no further vſe of miracles in the Church: but if any controuerſies did ariſe in religion, men were not to ſeeke the deciſion of them by new miracles, but by the holy Scriptures, which were giuen of God to be the rule of faith, and touchſtone of truth and falſhood, and the ſupreme iudge of controuerſies. Thus ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 2. Cor. 2. hom. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Miracles were then profitably wrought, and are profitably now not wrought: for now we confirme our doctrine by diuine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by thoſe miracles which were wrought before.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de vera. Relig. cap. 5.</note> So S. <hi>Auguſtine, Our Fathers followed viſible miracles, whereby it is come to paſſe, that they are not neceſſary for their poſterity. Miracles</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory) were neceſſary in the beginning of the Church, that faith being nouriſhed thereby, might encreaſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregor. in Euangel. hom. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>as we when we plant trees, do water them till they be ſettled in earth, but not afterward. Eſpencaeus</hi> alſo faith plainly,<note place="margin">Eſpenſ. in 2. Tim. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That where there are no infidels, there is no neceſſity of miracles: as long as there was a vocation from infidelity to faith, miracles were wrought by Chriſts miniſters: but this vocation ceaſing, and ſeduction from faith to infidelity comming in place thereof, the power of doing miracles, was to be giuen vp to it, as an helpe thereunto.</hi> But <hi>Stella</hi> aboue the reſt,<note place="margin">Stella in Luk. 11.</note> diſcourſeth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently vpon this matter. For he ſheweth, firſt, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are not now neceſſary in the Church, being growne and confirmed, as they were in the firſt planting thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he which beleeueth not for the miracles already done, will much leſſe beleeue if new ones be propounded vnto him. And thirdly, that miracles now are rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then profitable: as a child when he beginneth firſt to go, is ſupported with a little chariot, which would be an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Stella,</hi> a man of their owne ſect and religion: And therefore to conclude againe with S. <hi>Auguſtine: Whoſoeuer yet ſeeketh for wonders that he may beleeue, he himſelfe is the greateſt wonder,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 22. c. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>who, the world beleeeuing, beleeueth not.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to all which, is that of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Tongues are a ſigne not to them that beleeue, but to them that beleeue not.</hi> So that their vaunt of miracles, is nothing elſe but an Antichriſtian brauado.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, obſerue that miracles are not the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to try the truth of doctrine by, but the truth of doctrine the touchſtone of miracles, whether they be true or falſe: and ſo of Doctors and Preachers, they are neither to bee proued or diſproued by their miracles, but are to be tryed by their doctrine. This propoſition is euidently proued by two expreſſe Texts of Scripture: the one, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.2.3. &amp;c. and the ſecond, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. For albeit, ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as are wrought by falſe Prophets for the confirmation of an vntruth, are for the moſt part no true miracles, but counterfeit and fained; neuertheleſſe admit they were true, (as oftentimes God doth co-operate with falſe teachers, for the puniſhment of mens impenitency) yet whether they be true or falſe, doctrine is not to be tryed by them, but they by it.<note place="margin">Tertul de pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. c. 44.</note> Therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of Heretikes ſaith, <hi>That they confirme the faith of their doctrine, by oſtentation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as that they had raiſed the dead, cured diſeaſes, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told things to come, to the end, they might be counted true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as if it were not written, that many falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets ſhould ariſe, that ſhall ſhow great ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is more direct in this point, whoſe words in his booke of the vnity of the Church, are worthy to be remembred: they are theſe: <hi>Let none ſay it is therefore true, becauſe Donatus, or Pont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So then, when they ſay, that theirs is the true Church, and their Miniſters the true Miniſters of Chriſt, becauſe it is illuſtrated with miracles; and our Church and miniſteriall miſſion falſe, becauſe we haue no miracles: The anſwere is, firſt, that if this were a good argument, then the Pagans and Donatiſts were the true Church aſwell as they, who brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of their miracles aſmuch as they: and Antichriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhould haue his miſſion from God, becauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is with great ſignes and wonders, as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. And ſecondly, that our want of miracles, is ſo farre from prouing vs to be none of Chriſts Church, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs rather to be his Church, according both to S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> opinions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, obſerue that miracles are not ſo frequent and common in their Church, as they were in former times: for whereas heretofore they were ſo vſuall, that ſcarſe a day paſſed without ſome new miracle; and ſcarce an Image or Saint, that were not renowned therewith: now we ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare of one in many yeeeres, &amp; that in ſome few notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places, as at <hi>Lauretto, Hals,</hi> and <hi>Sichem,</hi> and ſuch like. Now I demand, where are their miracles that they ſo much bragge of? And if they tell vs of thoſe that were wrought in former times I aske againe, where is that power now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Is it flowne into the <hi>Indies</hi> to be practiſed there by the Ieſuites for the conuerſion of thoſe vnbeleeuing Pagans? So indeed they ſay.<note place="margin">Acoſta de ſalute Indor. lib. 6. cap. 4. et cap 12. et c. 17</note> But their owne <hi>Acoſta</hi> an eye-witneſſe doth giue the lye to this fiction, for thus he writeth: <hi>What is our preaching? And what is our confidence? Certainly we worke no miracles to confirme our doctrine, neither is there any neede of them: ſo to ſhine in holineſſe before men, that they ſeeing our good workes, may glorifie our Father which is in heauen, this is the greateſt perſwading miracle that can be.</hi> Therefore <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> thus cenſureth thoſe fabulous bookes,<note place="margin">Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. loc. lib. 11. cap. 6.</note> that were written of this ſubiect: <hi>There are of late</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1279:166"/> 
                  <hi>certaine fables come forth, the Author whereof, and the place where they were acted, are ſo farre off, that it is not poſſible to diſcouer their falſhood: but yet the whole body of the narration is ſo contriued, that the Spaniſh prouerbe may eaſily appeare to be verified in them: Des lueng as vias, luengas meniras,</hi> that is, <hi>From farre Countries, long lyes.</hi> And ſuch are their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an miracles. But what need they trauaile ſo farre for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, if they be neceſſary markes of their Church? And why are they not ſtill wrought, at the ſepulchers and relikes of their Saints, as they pretend they were in time paſt? Marry the reaſon is, becauſe the deuill feares to play his tricks in the day, leaſt he ſhould be diſcouered, but loueth the darkneſſe, as becommeth the Prince of darkneſſe.<note place="margin">Nicephor. hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 17.</note> As at the riſing of the Sunne, Owles and Bats, and all night birdes, hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their holes: ſo did theſe ſuperſtitious fables, at the breaking out of the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpell. And as at the comming of Chriſt, the Oracles ceaſed, and the great God <hi>Pan</hi> died; ſo at the preaching of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Plutarch de defectis cracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum. Euſeb. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. Euang. lib. 5. cap. 9.</note> miracles in a manner vaniſhed, and all thoſe ſuperſtitions were aſhamed to ſhew their faces. And this indeed is the greateſt miracle of this Age, that the falſhood of miracles is thus diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to leaue the generall, and to come to more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcouery of Popiſh miracles, and to ſhew that they are no better then lying ſignes and wonders, ſuch as are aſcribed to Antichriſt by S. <hi>Paul:</hi> They may well be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into three rankes. For ſome are altogether falſe and counterfeit, yea many ſo ridiculous, that they carry with them no likelyhood of truth. A ſecond ſort are true, but are not miracles, hauing nothing in them that is prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ſupernaturall. And a third ſort there are, which to our ſenſes ſeeme miraculous, foraſmuch as they ſurpaſſe our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but are wrought by the operation of Sathan, and by the deceite of vncleane ſpirits. And to this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſtian miracles,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Rom.

The firſt is, that on a certaine time he being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to play the Cooke, ſet on a kettle with Pullets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pulling, drawing, or waſhing them, together with other fl ſh and rootes in like manner: and hauing made theſe boyle together vpon a great fire, brought this braue diſh to his compainions, who found no diſtaſt nor ſluttery in it, but all as fine and neat as might bee. This tale cals to my minde another of the ſame nature, but of a contrary effect, to wit of a Pilgrime, that comming to demand iuſtice for the murther of his Sonne of a Magiſtrate, who being then at dinner, was vnwilling to heare him: hee cauſed the Capon that was on the table ready d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fie the truth and equity of his complaint. The ſecond ſtory of Friar <hi>Iuniper</hi> is, that being lodged at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time by a friend, in a faire bed and white ſheetes, hee left behinde him in the bed his filthy Excrements for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without bidding his Hoſt ſo much as fare well: now theſe two honeſt ſtories are recited in that booke, to ſhew the humility of this holy Friar: but this is humility with a witneſſe, except he was moued to ſuch an act by reuelation, or that the thing he left behinde him in the bed, was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiticall perfume, and not a ſtincking excrement, and then he was a great deale more holy then another Friar called <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin,</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:1279:170"/> who made the deuill to flee away with this threat, that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

S <hi>Genoule,</hi> who when his wife chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay, that he could worke miracles as well as her backe ſide could ſing; laid this puniſhment vpon her, that all the reſt of her life, ſhe neuer opened her mouth to ſpeak, but a cracke with an euill ſauour came out behinde. But to returne to S. <hi>Iuniper,</hi> it is no maruaile that he was ſo humble to beguild his bed, ſeeing (as it is in the book of Conformities from whence theſe braue ſtories are fetcht) one Friar <hi>Iohn de Vallees</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he ſmelt the ſauour of the ſaid <hi>Iuniper</hi> 12. leagues off, ſo odoriferous was his ſanctified body. We read in the Legend of Saint <hi>Machary,</hi> that he did penance ſeuen yeeres, amongſt thornes and buſhes, for that vnaduiſedly hee killed a Flea that bit him; neither can I forget another act of Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> recited towards the end of his Legend, an act to make good companions laugh, and geare at: it is this. There was a certaine Nun called <hi>Mary,</hi> that was diſeaſed in her thigh for the ſpace of fiue moneths, with great paine and hazard of her life: at laſt ſhe thought with her ſelfe that ſhee was vnworthy to pray vnto God, and to be heard;<note place="margin">Vide Hen.

               <p n="9">9. But not to trouble the Reader with more of theſe idle Fables, I paſſe ouer Saint <hi>Germaine,</hi> who preaching in <hi>Britaine,</hi> becauſe the King did not entertaine him in his houſe, therefore the next day poſſeſſed him of his Crowne,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1279:171"/> and placed a Neat-heard in his roome, that had entertained him: and Saint <hi>Coſme</hi> and <hi>Damicen,</hi> who cured a deuout worſhipper of them, of a Gangrene in his thigh, by cutting it off whilſt he ſlept, and fetching a Blackemores thigh that was lately buried, and faſtning it in the place thereof. And Friar <hi>Bennet</hi> of <hi>Arezze,</hi> who being a deuout worſhipper of Saint <hi>Daniel,</hi> whoſe Sepulcher is in <hi>Babilon,</hi> was carried thither vpon the taile of a Dragon, and cut off his finger for a Relike, and was brought againe by the ſame meanes he went; and how he being in a tempeſt caſt into the Sea, was like a ſecond <hi>Ionas,</hi> encloſed with a cloud, and tranſported into Paradiſe; where being asked of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> what he was; he anſwered, I am a brother of S. <hi>Francis:</hi> which <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> no ſooner heard, but they danced for ioy, and led him vp and downe to view that pleaſant place: from whence, he was preſently after taken by a little cloud, and carried againe into the Sea, which men ſeeing, were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſtoniſhed. I omit (I ſay) theſe, with a number more, and end with their tales of the bleſſed Virgin, and our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt. For as their owne <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> affirmeth, they haue euen dared to abuſe them with their Lyes, as they haue done other Saints. For their fabulous tales and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles concerning Chriſt, I referre the Reader to thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrypha bookes which are written of the life of Chriſt, where they ſhall finde a whole thraue of them. As for the bleſſed Virgin, they attribute to her ſuch ſtrange miracles, as doe rather deſerue contempt then credit. As that ſhee changed her ſelfe into the forme and habit of one <hi>Beatrix</hi> a Nun, and ſerued in her roome fifteene yeeres, whilſt ſhee played the Harlot abroad, and that at length <hi>Beatrix</hi> being oppreſſed with pouerty, came to the Nunnery gate in a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar habit, and asked the Porter whether he knew <hi>Beatrix</hi> or no,<note place="margin">Caeſar.

A tale deuiſed by filthy Monkes, to encourage their deuout ſiſters to play the harlots freely, in hope that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> would couer their faults: and thus they make a Virgin, a patroneſſe of whoredome; as may appeare alſo by another tale. A certaine Abbeſſe being with child,<note place="margin">Miracoli, della glorieſa Virg. Mar. imprima millian, Anno. 1547.</note> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to hide her fault, preſented her ſelfe in her ſhape to the Biſhop to be examined, and ſhewed by proofe that ſhe was not with child, and ſo cleared her from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But they do not onely make her a patroneſſe of whoredome, but of theft alſo, as this tale witneſſeth. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine woman hauing robbed her husband, ran away with a Prieſt that had alſo robbed the Veſtery, and being purſued and taken, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> commanded the deuill that had tempted them to this ſinne, to deliuer them againe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to their owner; who preſently freed them of their priſonment, and put the woman in bed with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the Prieſt in his owne houſe, bringing back againe alſo the things they had ſtollen into both places, and inſtead of them, left two deuils in priſon in their ſhapes: and ſo they denying the fact, &amp; the deuils being found in the priſon who manifeſted what they were, and vaniſhed; the parties were acquit both of their puniſhment, and reproach. What ſhall I relate how another woman tooke the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> Son out of her armes, and vowed to keepe him from her, as ſhe did, till ſhe had freed her ſonne which was in priſon? And how they bring her in ſometimes kiſſing an armed man, or a Monke, ſometimes giuing ſucke with her teates, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times giuing a man a box on the eare, with a number ſuch like vnbeſeeming acts: or how to ſaue the credit of an Abbeſſe who was with child, ſhe commanded two Angels to play the midwiues, and to carry the child in her name, to a certaine Hermite, to be kept for her till it was ſeuen yeeres old: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Or how ſhe came to the Cell of one <hi>Alanus,</hi> and was ſo familiar with him, that ſhe not onely eſpouſed him to her husband, but alſo kiſſed him, and opened to him her paps, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great plenty of her owne milke into his mouth. Theſe are
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1279:172"/> ſufficient if not too many, to ſhew, not onely the falſity, but alſo the ridiculouſneſſe, of moſt of their miracles which they ſo bragge of; and how fitly they anſwer thoſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> aſcribe vnto Antichriſt.</p>

In briefe, if any one by any meanes were cured of ſome greeuous diſeaſe, or were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of priſon, or his ſhip after a tempeſt were arriued at a good Hauen, or eſcaped ſhip-wracke, or any ſuch like thing; if the party called vpon any of their Saints, preſently they cry, A miracle, as if ſome extraordinary matter was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; when it is meerly the prouidence and goodneſſe of God, that cauſeth the Sunne to ſhine vpon the iuſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt that hath done it: and ſurely in ſuch things if any thing be miraculous, it is the ingratitude of men, who hauing felt the ſuccour ſo preſent of the diuine Maieſty in their neceſſities, in ſtead of offering vp vnto him the cup of thankſgiuing, they giue the glory of their deliuerances to Idols, and dead crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo robbe him of the homage which is due vnto him.

Amongſt other things, they perſwade the ſilly people, that ſhe knew the ſinnes of all perſons; and indeed ſhe would tell them that came vnto her, the ſinnes that they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but it was by this meanes: the Friars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He relateth another alſo, acted by the maſters of the ſame faculty, to wit, how a gallant of this trade, being offended that nothing was giuen vnto him at a poore husbandmans hou e, ſet fire on the ſtable where his Kine were, which burned not onely the ſtable, but the reſt of his houſe, and all his goods: and this went currant for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> till the villany was diſcouered. He addeth alſo another ſtory of the ſame ſubiect, how another of S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Prieſts, cozened a poore butcher and his wife of a peece of linnen cloth, by perſwading his wife, firſt that her two Swine which ſhe had, would ſhortly turne vp their heeles, vnleſſe they were cured by ſome holy bleſſing of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> For which, ſhe muſt giue him that peece of linnen cloth which was in her houſe, which ſhe did: and then by deluding her husband that purſued him for the cloth, with putting ſome fire into it, which made it to burne and ſmoke, ſo that the poor man aſtoniſhed, gaue backe the cloth to the Prieſt, and cryed the miracle, and went about the Country with him to publiſh the ſame. Againe, in the Country of <hi>Berry</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide Henric.

               <p n="12">12. It is no newes, nor ſtrange thing, to heare of infinite numbers of blinde, lame, and diſeaſed perſons, that haue bene cured by ſuch a Saint, or ſuch a Crucifix, or ſuch an Image; and eſpecially by the Images of our Lady at <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto, Halls,</hi> and <hi>Sichem,</hi> and other places. But it is to be noted, that though ſome ſuch cures might be wrought by the power of Sathan, to further ſuperſtition; yet moſt of them were meerly counterfeit: for it hath bene an ordinary practiſe of Popiſh Prieſts, to haue men to faine themſelues blind, or lame, or otherwiſe ill affected with ſome dangerous diſeaſe, and then to returne as if they were ſound and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. There be many examples of this kind of impoſture: But I will relate onely three, out of <hi>Henry Stephanus Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> The firſt is of S. <hi>Renand</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the ſuburbes of our Ladie of the fieldes, which Saint, the Monks of that place would make men beleeue, was the moſt holy and greateſt worker of miracles, that was within fifty miles round about. And to this effect, they ſuborned certaine lame, and blind, and other counterfeites, who knew their watch-word, when they ſhould cry, <hi>I am cured:</hi> But it happened, that one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, that ſaid he was borne blinde, and making the ſame outcry, <hi>I can ſee:</hi> a certaine man deſirous to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the abuſe, bad him if he could ſee, to tell him what colour the lining of his cloake was of; the counterfeit preſently to proue that he could ſee, told him directly the colour: which being heard of many, their knauery was reuealed; for how
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1279:174"/> could a man borne blind iudge of colours? The ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is, of thoſe that faine themſelues ſicke of the falling ſickneſſe, which is called S. <hi>Iohns</hi> euill, and therefore they vſe to pray vnto him for remedy thereof.

And to conclude, what ſhould I ſpeake of the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, weeping, nodding, ſtretching forth the hand, and ſuch like actions of their images? are they not all forged in the ſame ſhop? The Image of the bleſſed Virgin is ſaid to haue ſpoken to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> bidding him good morrow, and to S. <hi>Hyacynth,</hi> entreating him to take her and her Sonne with him, when he fled from the <hi>Tartarians:</hi> and to <hi>Alexius,</hi> who ſtaying long in the Church Porch, the image of our Lady bad the Sexton let him in.

Concerning all which, I may giue the ſame cenſure, that <hi>Polydore <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil,</hi> otherwiſe a ſtrong Papiſt, doth of the laſt; that they were nothing but the contriuings of ſubtile Prieſts, who hiding themſelues, either behinde or in the hollow of the image, vttered theſe voyces: witneſſe theſe few examples. A certaine <hi>Florentine,</hi> a deuout worſhipper of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, was at a time inquiſitiue of the image of this Saint, whether his wife had euer plaid falſe with him or no: which requeſt being ouer-heard of ſome <hi>bon compagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he placed himſelfe ſo cloſely behinde the image, that the next day when the deuout iealous foole came againe, he ſpake vnto him, and bad him come againe the next day, and he ſhould be reſolued of his doubt: he ſuppoſing it to be the voyce of the Saint, came at the time appointed, and then the other not failing to lurke in his old place, told him that his wife had plaid falſe, and that he was a cuckold: at which the poore man, being firſt abaſhed, at length grew into choller, and ſaid to the image: <hi>Curſed be thou of God, thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bene an euill tongued Saint, and therefore Herod cut off thy head:</hi> and ſo with other reproachfull ſpeeches he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in diſcontent.

A Cooke of <hi>Florence,</hi> that v ed with great deuotion to worſhip an image of a yong Ieſus Chriſt, to wit, of that age which he was of when his mother found him in the Temple diſputing with the Doctors, had but one Sonne, who with a tyle fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on his head, was ſo wounded, that he was like hardly to eſcape. Then the Father runneth in haſt to his little image, and inſtead of a candle which he vſed to offer vnto it, brought a good rod to terrifie it, praying it ſince he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him ſo long, &amp; had neuer receiued any boone from him, now to grant him the life of his child, that was all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1279:175"/> and hope: but his Sonne dyed, and he in a rage retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his little Ieſus, and without either kneeling or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſaid vnto him: <hi>Thou boy, I renounce thee, and will neuer ſerue thee more: wouldſt thou not grant me this one requeſt, for all the ſeruice I haue done thee? If I had prayed to this great crucifix which is hard by thee, I know I ſhould haue bene heard, but this it is to deale with boyes, I promiſe thee for thy ſake I will neuer haue to do with boyes againe.</hi> What ſottiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, what prophane ſuperſtition is here? Ignorance, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing betwixt a great Ieſus and a little one, an old and a yong: and prophaneneſſe, in defying him whom he had worſhipped as his God. But to returne to my purpoſe of ſpeaking images. There was one that prayed to the image of our Lady, and hearing an anſwer that pleaſed him not, made by ſome iugling Prieſt behind the image, he iudged by the manner of the voyce, that it was not the mother that ſpake, but the child, and therefore ſaid vnto him, <hi>Hold thy peace thou little wagge, ſuffer thy mother to ſpeake, who is elder then thou.</hi> By this hand full of flower, we may iudge of the whole batch of talking images: And that the Weeping, Sweating, Nodding, and Mouing of images, is a loafe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the ſame ouen, as diuers examples do teſtifie: for their teares and ſweat might eaſily be procured, by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by night into ſome concauity of the image, either wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or oyle: or by annoynting their faces without, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them within, with a chafing-diſh of coles. As old men in the Country ſticke not to tell of an image at <hi>Berry,</hi> neere the Abbey of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> which vſed to ſweat; and that ſweat was held a ſoueraigne remedy againſt all aches, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the backe; and therefore happy was he that could get any of it in his handkercheife. So there was a crucifix at <hi>Maret,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Houeden.</note> neere vnto <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> downe whoſe cheekes teares vſed to diſtill ordinarily; but deceitfully, as my Author affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue bene proued by ſearch.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:1279:175"/> maruaile, for they ſay it was the vſe of that Rood alwaies to mourne when a Biſhop departed. Concerning mouing of the hand, the Image of Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> at <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> may ſerue to diſcouer the tricke of all the reſt: for at the burning of it in the market place of the City, it was found that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was made with ſuch a deuiſe, that if one ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde did pull a certaine ſtring which was in the backe part thereof, it would moue the hand as if it bleſſed the people. This is knowne to be true by many of the inhabitants yet liuing. But this was a bleſſing Image: the next I ſpeake of, was hurting and malicious. For when as a certaine Peaſant of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> neere vnto a Towne called <hi>Chaſcule,</hi> was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Crucifix for the ſoule of one newly deceaſed, and for whom the Bels rang, the Crucifix in ſtead of making onely a ſigne to him by nodding his head, by the weight of him that was behinde it, fell downe right vpon him, and ſo cruſhing the poore man, that the ringers were faine to leaue the Bels, and carry him to his houſe halfe dead; where hee lay ſicke a long time, after which ſickneſſe returning to the Church, and ſeeing a faire young Crucifix with a ſmiling countenance in place of the old, which had broken it necke in the fall, hee could not forbeare but ſay thus vnto it: <hi>What good countenance ſoeuer thou caſt vpon me, yet I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer truſt thee: for if thou liue to the age of a man, thou wilt bee as wicked as thy Father that thought to kill mee.</hi> I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large this point with many more ſuch like examples; but theſe I thinke are ſufficient to declare, that a great part of their pretended miracles, are nothing but things either effected by naturall cauſes, or deuiſed by ſubtle Prieſts for their owne gaine. And they themſelues when they call <hi>Piae frandes,</hi>

               <p n="14">14. As touching the third ſort of their miracles, they are ſuch as are indeed things admirable to the eyes and opinion
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1279:176"/> of men, but yet are not true miracles, which cannot bee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected but by a Diuine power: whereas theſe are meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the workes and effects of euill ſpirits, as were the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, the deuill heerein ayding his ſeruants, and enabling them to worke meruailes for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his owne kingdome. As for example, cannot the deuill willingly quit a poſſeſſed <hi>Demoniack,</hi> making ſhew to be forced thereunto by Exorciſmes? Cannot he diſturbe the humours in a body, and ſo cauſe ſome ſudaine ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which ſhall ceaſe as ſoone as hee withdraweth his working? They heale truely, when they ceaſe to hurt. He that deſireth examples of theſe wonderments, ſhall finde a full armefull of them, in the booke of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with Chriſt. For whereas it relateth ſo many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the ſicke and diſeaſed, ſo many raiſings of the dead, and other ſtrange things done by him and his diſciples, that it might ſeeme they had all miracles at command, and that it was as eaſie and ordinary for them to worke a miracle as for to eate and drinke: what ſhould we imagine, but that either they are lying Fables, or if true, feates of Sathan to delude mens ſoules? For is it likely that they ſhould exceed Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in the power of working miracles? And to whom but Sathan can we aſcribe it, if it be true that Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Cowle ſhould be ſo miraclificous, as to giue ſight to three blinde perſons, a man and two women? and that his Breeches had that vertue in them, to make women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with Child that were naturally barren? with a number ſuch like. But they bragge of no miracles ſo much as of thoſe that haue accompained their Maſſe: and yet can they not produce a ſtranger wonder in this kinde, then that which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reporteth to haue beene acted by a certaine he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Impoſtor,<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. 9.</note> called <hi>Marke.</hi> For in celebrating this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, he ſo changed the colour of the wine, that it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be very blood, and cauſed a little wine ſo to puffe vp and ſwell, that it filled the whole Cup, and ran ouer, yea and another greater veſſell alſo without any addition or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the liquor.

So that when we heare of mouing Images, of Saints going through the fire without burning, of entring Churches and other places the doores being ſhut, of plagues falling vpon thoſe that deſpiſed their Saints, and ſuch like things; wee ought to remember that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did by the power of the deuill as much, or more.<note place="margin">Baron.

This is ſo common a tricke in the Papacy, to bring water to their Mill, and to drayne mens purſes; as it will be but loſt labour to ſtand much vpon it. Therefore to paſſe ouer examples which are frequent in this kinde of deluſion: I ſay onely, that it was, and is, an ordinary cuſtome and practiſe of the Romiſh Prieſts, when they confeſſed ſuch perſons as lay at the point
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1279:180"/> of death, to cauſe them to make S. <hi>Francis,</hi> or S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> or ſome other Saint, the Patrone of their Religion, their heire, or elſe they could not be ſaued: by which meanes, they drew from ſome halfe, from others two third parts, and from others the whole ſumme of their ſubſtance; which ſhould haue bene to maintaine their wife and children: for ſometimes if the children refuſed to turne Monkes, they ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vpon all as their owne inheritance. There be extant at this day many Teſtaments and Wils, that giue faith to this report. But that which is worſe then all, is, that ofttimes they do not ſtay till men be neere their end, but make them put off their clothes ere they be willing to go to bed, as the prouerbe ſpeaketh. Their Croyſado is a notable trick to this purpoſe; for neuer did any theefe ſo iniuriouſly take a trauellers purſe by the high way, as the Croyſado miniſters do ſecretly robbe and ſpoile infinite numbers of people; and that not onely the rich, but euen the poore alſo; making them to borrow, beg, or ſteale, to giue to this holy vſe; or elſe neitheir themſelues, nor their children, can be ſaued. By which meanes it is no doubt, but that many of theſe poore people, in ſtead of redeeming their ſoules from the deuill, as they ſuppoſed, haue euen ſold them into his hands. It is no new nor ſoft cry of theirs, that Paradiſe is to be bought for money, as the old Latine verſes found in S. <hi>Stephens</hi> Church at <hi>Bourges,</hi> engrauen in a Table of ſtone beare witneſſe. The firſt whereof is this, <hi>Hic des deuote, coeleſtibus aſſocio te:</hi> but neuer were men conſtrained to buy Paradiſe till this trick of the Croyſado was inuented: for the authorization and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof, the Preach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs of thoſe times alleadged many ſtrange tales and reportes, as this one among the reſt; that when the liuing gaue money to the Prieſts for the dead, the ſoules that were in Purgatory, hearing the ſound of the money ting in the baſon, fell a laughing for ioy of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus was the world deluded in thoſe times, by theſe panick feares of that ſuppoſed fire of Purgatory, which men ſtood in more awe of, then of hell it ſelfe. But yet ſome
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1279:180"/> were wiſer then others, and eaſily ſmelt out this religious fraud: of which ſort I will propound ſome few examples. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, being beſieged in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> together with certaine Prelates his friends, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Rome</hi> was bold thus to ſay, <hi>Hitherto I haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the Pope could deliuer ſoules out of Purgatory: but now ſeeing that he cannot free himſelfe out of this earthly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I am conſtrained to beleeue, that much leſſe can be deliuer ſoules out of that infernall priſon.</hi> Another ieſt was acted at <hi>Florence,</hi> of the ſame mettall with the former: A certaine Florentine being importuned by ſome Friars, to cauſe Maſſe to be ſung, to deliuer the ſoule of his Sonne lately deceaſed out of Purgatory; hee conſented, and promiſed them a crowne for their paines, when they had deliuered his Sonnes ſoule: whereupon the Friars hauing ſung their Maſſes, forgot not to demand their crowne. But the Florentine made them this anſwer: <hi>If you make it appeare vnto me, that you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him out of Purgatory, you ſhall haue your crowne, but not before that be done.</hi> The Friars, after long conteſtation, complained to the Duke, and deſired iuſtice againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who called the man before him, and demanded why he did not pay them according to his promiſe? to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that his promiſe was vpon condition, that they ſhould deliuer his ſonnes ſoule out of Purgatory; which if it might appeare that they had done, he would preſently pay them. The Duke hearing this, told the Friars that the man had reaſon; and therefore cauſe either the ſoule that you haue deliuered to come before me in perſon, and teſtifie his deliuerance, or let him ſend two other ſoules to witneſſe the ſame, or at leaſt let him ſend a letter ſigned with the hand of Ieſus Chriſt, and then you ſhall bee ſure to receiue your crowne. Thus was Purgatory derided, at <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> vnder the Popes noſe, and that in the time of their greateſt blindneſſe. Another like mockage was committed in <hi>France;</hi> for when as the Prieſts demanded their pay of a certaine man for deliuering a ſoule out of Purgatory by their Maſſes, he asked them; If a ſoule that was once come out of that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:1279:181"/> priſon were in any danger to returne thither againe? Who an wered, No: why then (quoth he) there is no neede that I ſhould giue you money for this ſoule that is already deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and in ſafety; I will rather keepe it for the deliuerance of one that is ſtill there detained. An <hi>Italian</hi> alſo at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> in as merry a moode, and with as good a grace, told the Popes Legate; that if his Holineſſe had bene well aduiſed, hee would not haue ſaid that he could deliuer ſoules out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but out of Hell. For concerning Purgatory, there were two things to proue: Firſt, that there is a Purgatory: and ſecondly, that he can deliuer ſoules out of it: whereas euery one beleeueth that there is a hell, and ſo there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing but to proue, that he could deliuer ſoules out of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that doth but well conſider the reaſons which they alledge for Purgatory, will ſay that there neuer was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deluſion in the world: for to omit the Texts of Scripture, which they wreſt and wring till they bleed againe, againſt all ſenſe for the proofe thereof: they vſe beſides in their preaching, many pretty tales, to amaze and delude the vulgar ſort. A certaine preacher at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, ſpeaking againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue there was a Purgatory, ſaid, he would tell his Auditors a ſtory to confute theſe fellowes; which was this, and thus: I rode (ſaith he) late one euening to my fathers houſe at S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> bridge, and as I was riding with my man before me on a very good horſe that carried my cloak-bag, his horſe ſtayed on a ſuddaine contrary to his cuſtome, and began to puffe and ſhort: I bad my man to ſpurre him: ſo I do ſaid he, but he will not go forward; for a certaine I know he ſeeth ſomething: Then I remembring what my mother had told me long before, that in that very place ſhe had ſeene ſome apparition; I fell to my <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and <hi>Aue,</hi> and bad my man againe to ſpurre his horſe forward, which he did, but the horſe hauing gone two or three ſteps, ſtopped againe, and began a freſh to puffe and blow; my man then told me againe, that doubtleſſe there was ſome ſpirit in the way;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1279:181"/> and then I ſaid my <hi>De profundis,</hi> which was no ſooner done, but the horſe went forward, and by and by ſtopped the third time; I had no ſooner ſaid, <hi>Auete omnes animae et Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem aeternam,</hi> but he paſſed freely without any more ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Therefore ſeeing theſe wicked <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay there is no Purgatory, and that we ought not to pray for the dead; I ſend them to my mans cloak-bagge horſe, euen to my mans horſe, to learne their leſſon. This Aſſe-like reaſon you ſee is taken from an horſe, and indeed fitter for a horſe to beleeue then a man. Another preacher, a gray Friar, called <hi>Bardotti,</hi> being demanded why the good theefe went right into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and taſted not of Purgatory, ſeeing he had not done any pennance here on earth; anſwered, that the reaſon (as he found it related in a certaine Goſpell) was, for that when Chriſt being an infant, was carried into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> this theefe hindered his companions from robbing him, and thoſe that were with him, and alſo that he then ſaid to Chriſt; I pray you beare in memory the good turne that I do you; which was promiſed by Chriſt, and this promiſe was then perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when they were crucified together: for in recompence of his good turne, he freed him from Purgatory, and led him directly into Paradiſe. But I wonder in what Goſpell hee found this. Sure I am, neither in <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn,</hi> but in ſome Apocrypha Goſpell, if rather it were not alye forged in his owne braine. Take with you two or three ſtories more, and then I ſhall leaue this Popiſh fire to be quenched, or kindled at their pleaſures. The Cordeliers or gray Friars, and the Iacobins, enuying each others gaine and thriuing, and labouring to get cuſtome in their trades, thus encountred together. A gray Friar preaching to the people in a towne of <hi>Sicily,</hi> made his Auditours beleeue, that S. <hi>Francis</hi> euery yeere vpon his Feaſt day, deſcended into Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and deliuered from thence, all the ſoules of ſuch as had bene bountifull to his brethren. The Iacobins percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that by this tale the Cordeliers had gained much cuſtome, and profit, and ſo hindered their trading, began to preach, that the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as hauing more charity and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1279:182"/> authority then S. <hi>Francis,</hi> did not leaue as he did, her deuout followers and benefactors a whole yeere in Purgatory, but ſeuen daies, onely at the longeſt: for euery Saturday (which day is dedicated vnto her) ſhe deſcended into Purgatory, to redeeme thence all thoſe that had giuen almes to her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: which deuice of theirs being beleeued, brought them againe into more credit and trading then euer they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The other tale is out of S. <hi>Brandons</hi> Legend, where to perſwade ſilly people, that their prayers and Maſſes are able to deliuer ſoules out of Purgatory; they tell how <hi>Iudas</hi> is permitted to come out of hell euery Saturday at Euen ſong time, and to reſt himſelfe on a certaine rock in the Sea, vntill all the Sunday ſeruice be performed: concluding ſtrongly, that if the praiers of the Church can eaſe for a time the paines of hell to the damned, much more are they of force to free the ſoules of the Saints out of Purgatory, and ſend them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into heauen. A third is in the life of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> at the day of whoſe death (ſaith the Legend) there died in the whole world, three thouſand thirty and three: of whom the three thouſand went directly into hell, thirty into Purgatory, and three onely into Paradiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> was one. And this (ſaith it) was reuealed by one of them that went to heauen, to a friend of his vpon earth: <hi>Sum praedicant. tit. mors.</hi> By theſe and a thouſand ſuch like fictions and fables, touching this purging fire, they kept the world in awe; and deluded them after a miſerable manner for their owne gaine: it being no maruaile, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purgatory maintaines them, and their pompe, and pride, they alſo maintaine it, and ſtoutly ſtand in the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for what with counterfeit apparitions of dead ghoſts, and ſuch terrible tales of tormented ſoules, the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo ſcarred, that they ſpared for no coſt to preuent this paine: when in the meane while, for want of true faith and repentance, they caſt themſelues into hell and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 3.</hi> Deluſions by the Inuocation of Saints.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe ſecond ſort of their Saints, are ſuch as are either actually canonized by the Pope, or opiniatiuely in the mindes of men, and being freed from Purgatory, keepe their perpetuall reſidence in heauen. From theſe flow three kindes of deluſions: The firſt by their inuocation: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by their Relikes: and the third by their Images. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Inuocation, it is firſt to be obſerued, how al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Leiturgie of their Church in reſpect of their Saints, is borrowed from the Pagans, both for matter and forme. There is ſo great a conformity betwixt the Pagan Gods and Goddeſſes, and the Popiſh Saints and Sainteſſes, as it is hard to diſtinguiſh betwixt them: not a conformity in regard of the true Saints (leaſt I ſhould be miſtaken) but in regard of their worſhippers, who in all things imitate them, ſaue in their manner of ſacrificing. For the Pagans worſhipped dead men, whom they ſuppoſed to be placed in the number of the Gods, and attributed vnto them diuers offices, and charges ouer humane affaires; the which very ſame is practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.<note place="margin">Aruob. contra. Gentes. lib. 3.</note> And as <hi>Arucbius</hi> long agoe reproched the Pagans for forging vnto themſelues Gods, whereof ſome were Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſome Clothiers, ſome Mariners, ſome Muſitions, ſome Huntſmen, and ſome Heardſmen: one was a Piper, another a Midwife, another a Diuiner, another a Phyſitian: one was the God of Eloquence, another of Warre, another a Smith, &amp;c. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> had <hi>Bell</hi> for their tutelar God, The <hi>Aegyptians, Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſyris:</hi> The <hi>Rhodians,</hi> the <hi>Sunne:</hi> The <hi>Delphians, Apollo: Rome,</hi> a God that might not be named: The <hi>Athenians, Minerua:</hi> The <hi>Epheſians, Diana,</hi> &amp;c. So in like manner haue the Papiſts their Saints anſwerable to them in all reſpects: For do not S. <hi>Coſme,</hi> and S. <hi>Damian,</hi> ſucceed <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> in Phyſicke &amp; Chirurgery? For theſe are the Saints they pray vnto in theſe caſes.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1279:183"/> Among the Pagans, <hi>Iupiter</hi> was the God of the fire, <hi>Iuno</hi> of ayre, <hi>Tellus</hi> of the earth, and <hi>Neptune</hi> of the ſea: In ſtead of whom, the Papiſts haue for the fire S. <hi>Agathe,</hi> for the Sea S. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> For wine recommended to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> by the Pagans, and corne to <hi>Ceres;</hi> they haue S. <hi>Ioſſe,</hi> and S. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayne:</hi> In ſtead of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Pan,</hi> the ouerſeers and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their cattell, theſe haue found out S. <hi>Vandoline,</hi> or <hi>Wendeline</hi> for their ſheep: S. <hi>Eulogius</hi> for their horſes: S. <hi>Pelagius</hi> for their oxen and kine; and S. <hi>Anthony</hi> for their hogges. Among the Pagans, <hi>Apollo, Minerua,</hi> and the <hi>Muſes,</hi> were patrones of learning, <hi>Vulcane</hi> the God of the Forge and of Smithes, <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> of Phyſick, <hi>Mars</hi> of Warre, <hi>Diana</hi> of Hunting, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> of Harlots and Courtizans: In place of whom, the Papiſts haue for learning S. <hi>Catherine</hi> and S. <hi>Gregory;</hi> for Painters, S. <hi>Luke;</hi> for Phyſitians, S, <hi>Coſme</hi> and S. <hi>Damian;</hi> for Smiths, S. <hi>Eloi;</hi> for Hunters, S. <hi>Euſtachius</hi> and S. <hi>Hubert;</hi> for Harlots, S. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and S. <hi>Aphre.</hi> The Pagans had their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians for ſeuerall diſeaſes: as <hi>Apollo</hi> for the peſtilence, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> for the falling ſickneſſe, <hi>Lucina</hi> for the paines of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, &amp;c. The Papiſts in their roome, haue <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and S. <hi>Roche,</hi> for the peſtilence; S. <hi>Petronella</hi> for the feuer; S. <hi>Iohn</hi> or S. <hi>Valentine,</hi> for the falling ſickneſſe; and S. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> for women in trauaile: Yea ſo farre grew this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, that they aſcribe to ſeuerall Saints, the gouernment of the ſeuerall members of the body, which the Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans aſſigne to the twelue ſignes of the Zodiack. For S. <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> gouernes the head, S. <hi>Catherine</hi> guardeth the tongue, S. <hi>Apollonia</hi> cureth the teeth, S. <hi>Blaſe</hi> hath the neck in tuition, S. <hi>Lawrence</hi> the backe, back-bone and ſhoulders, S. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> the belly and the entrals, S. <hi>Apollinarius</hi> or S. <hi>Brice</hi> the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy parts, and ſo of the reſt: Yea inſtead of their filthy <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apus, Mutunus, Perſica, Pertunda,</hi> theſe haue ſubſtituted S. <hi>Guerlichon,</hi> and ſome others; that in nothing they might ſeeme ſhort of them in abhominable ſuperſtition. Neither want theſe like them their Patrones for ſundry Countries: as S. <hi>Denis,</hi> and S. <hi>Michael</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> for <hi>Spaine,</hi> S.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:1279:183"/> 
                  <hi>George</hi> for <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> for <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſo forth. Albeit that all theſe Countries are (as they ſay) vnder the ſpeciall protection of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to wit; <hi>Spaine</hi> by reaſon of the promiſe made that the bleſſed Virgin made to Saint <hi>Iames; Italy,</hi> by the choice that ſhee made of her reſidence there, tranſporting her Chamber to <hi>Lawretto; Germany,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of Temples dedicated there vnto her; and <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the chiefe Cities of that Country are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to her honours. Thus the Papiſts make by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, their Saints neere a kin to the heathen Gods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely, that whereas they eſteemed thoſe things that were written of their Gods but Fables, thoſe things that are written of their Saints are beleeued, and accounted as true Hiſtories; as it is a Fable that <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſlew <hi>Meduſa,</hi> but a true hiſtory in their account that Saint <hi>George</hi> ſlew the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. One thing they cannot deny, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth turned the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> a Temple dedicated vnto all their Gods, into a Church conſecrated to all Saints, and placed the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of Ieſus Chriſt in roome of <hi>Cybels</hi> the Mother of the Gods. I will adde yet another thing more notorious for impiety, to wit; that albeit in this reſemblance, I excepted ſacrificing, yet we finde that abomination alſo in ſome places. As for example, when in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ourraine</hi> they vſed to offer a Cocke to Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> for a certaine ſore in the top of the fingers: and to enlarge their ſuperſtition, it muſt be a white Cocke, otherwaies they ſhould rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the Saint to anger, then make him propitious vnto them. I will not ſpeake of their ſacrifice in the Maſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the greateſt part of the Ceremonies are deriued from the Pagans; nor of Purgatory, whereof the Pagan Poets were the firſt Authors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if wee conſider a little the ſeuerall Offices and Trades, together with the ſtrange names aſcribed to theſe their Saints, we ſhall more eaſily and clearely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their groſſe abuſe of the world in this kinde of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For touching their names, many of them are ſo fitted to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:1279:184"/> their Occupations, that a man cannot imagine, but that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were of purpoſe baptized with them for the credit of their offices, or that their offices were aſſigned vnto them in reſemblance of their names. For why elſe ſhould they call their ſweet ſmelling Saint, Saint <hi>Iuniper:</hi> their Saint for the diſeaſes of the hand, Saint <hi>Maine,</hi> as if it were Saint Hand, and hee which was for the Gowt which is commonly in the knee, Saint <hi>Genon,</hi> that is Saint Knee: for ſtinking dung and excrements Saint <hi>Fiacre,</hi> as we cry fie when our noſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter ſuch a ſauour: their Shoomakers Saint, Saint <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> as if it were Saint <hi>Pantofle:</hi> their Shrouetide or Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide Saints, Saint <hi>Mangeard,</hi> Saint <hi>Creuard,</hi> Saint <hi>Panſard:</hi> their Saint Protrectriſſe of Harlots Saint <hi>Aphre,</hi> as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then called <hi>Venus Aphrodit,</hi> as iſſuing out of froth, or Saint <hi>Magdalen,</hi> becauſe ſhe her ſelfe was once ſuch an one: Saint <hi>Suſanna</hi> for ſlanders, and Saint <hi>Iob</hi> for ſcabs, with a number more of the like nature. What doe theſe names I pray you import, but the meere gulling and deluding of the world? For why ſhould their names &amp; offices thus iumpe together, if it were not by fraudulent and impoſturous deuiſes of craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; couetous Prieſts? Beſides that, we may ſee how they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Pagans in their prophanenes: for though the Pagans had a large number of Gods, of the greater, middle, and leſſer ſize, as theſe haue of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts; yet alwayes they carried a more reuerent reſpect, and deuotion to their great <hi>Iupiter,</hi> then to all the reſt,<note place="margin">Plantus.</note> as he in the Poet ſaid, <hi>Dummodo Iupiter mihi propitius ſit, flocci facio minores Deos.</hi> But the Papiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all conſcience employ their Saints in all their affaires both great and ſmall, paſſing by God as an idle <hi>Idea,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome praying vnto him, in compariſon of the frequent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are made to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the other Saints. Their Beades ſhew this to bee true, where for one <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> they drop nine <hi>Aues:</hi> and their Temples and Altars, which are more ten to one dedicated to Saints, then to the bleſſed Trinity. And did euer the Pagans debaſe their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> ſo much, as to picture him like an old man with a ſtaffe in his hand, as theſe doe God the Father in their Churches?
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:1279:184"/> Or did they euer in contempt caſt their Gods into the fire or durt, as Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> did his breaden Chriſt; and another Prieſt threatned to doe to the ſame God of Paſte, if he could not aſſwage a tempeſt which was raiſed (as he ſuppoſed) by the deuill? And to conclude this point, albeit the Pagans imagined <hi>Pan</hi> to be the God of ſhepheardes and ſheepe; yet they neuer put any of their baſer ſort of Gods to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Geeſe and Swine, as theſe doe their Saints. Vpon which occaſion I remember a ſtory in <hi>Stephens Apologie</hi> for <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which I will not forbeare to relate for the ſolace of the Reader. It is, how a certaine young Gentlewoman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dangerous ſickneſſe, and hauing confeſſed her ſelfe to her Prieſt and receiued abſolution, ſaid vnto him that ſhe feared leaſt when ſhe ſhould come into Paradiſe, the charge of ſuch filthy Beaſts ſhould bee committed vnto her, and therefore it would bee a great contentment to her minde if ſhe might be made the Protectreſſe of little dogges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhe had beene formerly accuſtomed: but whether the Prieſt granted her ſuite, or no, I cannot coniecture: onely this I gather out of her requeſt, that the Pagans did not ſo vilifie their Idoll Gods, as the Papiſts do their Saints in their blinde ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ſhould I ſpeake of the great difference which is in the opinion of their beſt Legenders, touching the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices of their Saints? ſome aſcribing the ſame office to one Saint, which others doe vnto another. This is at large diſcouered by the forenamed Author <hi>Henry Stephen</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> for <hi>Herodo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi> and therefore I here but touch vpon this ſtring: onely mee thinkes it ſoundes in touching this plaine ſong, that all theſe ſuperſtitious inuocations of Saints, are no better then deuices of men, whereby they ſought both to enrich themſelues, and to impoueriſh the world. And is there any ſo ſottiſhly blinde, that will be thus deluded by them? For when the queſtion is, whether Saint <hi>Feriol,</hi> or Saint <hi>Andoche,</hi> or Saint <hi>Gallicut</hi> is the keeper of their Geeſe: or whether Saint <hi>Wendeline</hi> hath the care of ſheepe, or Saint <hi>Loupe:</hi> or whether Saint <hi>Genon</hi> be for the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:1279:185"/> Gowt, or Saint <hi>Maure:</hi> or whether Saint <hi>Roche</hi> be Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for ſcabbed hands, or Saint <hi>Maine:</hi> whether the eyes be committed to the charge of Saint <hi>Ottilia</hi> or Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> and of the teeth to Saint <hi>Apollonia,</hi> or to Saint <hi>Chriſtopher:</hi> becauſe of his great tooth kept as a relike in a certaine Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in <hi>France</hi> which is of that bigneſſe, that in proportion the mouth wherein it ſtood, muſt needs be as great as the mouth of the greateſt Furnace betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke.</hi> I ſay when as this queſtion reſts vndetermined, vntill the Pope and his Cardinals either decide it in their Conſiſtory, or call a Councill for that purpoſe, how can the poore people in theſe their neceſſities, either beleeue they ſhall be heard in their prayers, or not rather feare, that if they pray vnto a Saint that hath no intereſt in their cauſe, he will be offended for troubling him with matters that concerne him not, and the other that hath, will be angry for being neglected?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the higheſt ſtraine of impiety and Idolatry in their Inuocating of Saints is this, that there is no diſeaſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to man either in regard of body or minde, the cure whereof they doe not attribute to ſome one Saint or other. As for the body, the very itch in the hands to Saint <hi>Maine,</hi> and ſcald in the head to Saint <hi>Tignan,</hi> and cough in the lungs, to Saint <hi>Quintin;</hi> and the very French pox, to Saint <hi>Iob:</hi> And for the minde, the Frenzie (they ſay) is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Saint <hi>Acarius:</hi> and Iealouſie by Saint <hi>Auertine:</hi> but what ſhould we doubt of this, when ſterility and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a woman is remedied by the filthy duſt ſcraped off from a part of the Image of Saint <hi>Guerlichon,</hi> which ſhame and honeſty forbiddeth to name: or by ſtriding ouer Saint <hi>Rumbaulis</hi> breeches, which if a barren woman doe, ſhe ſhall be ſure to haue a child within a twelue-moneth, as they make poore people beleeue at this day? and ſo they make ſome of their Saints as filthy and abominable as the heathens did their <hi>Priapus.</hi> And that which is yet more abuſiue and abſurd, they affirme, that the ſame diſeaſes which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe Saints can cure, they can alſo ſend if they bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and ſo they muſt of neceſſity inuocate them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1279:185"/> in the hope of good, but for feare of hurt; as that good wife after ſhe had offered a candle to Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> offered another alſo to the deuill that ſtood by him, (for theſe two alwaies are painted together) that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hence it was, that if the Saint which they inuocated did not releeue them in their miſeries, then in anger they vſed to renounce him, and chooſe vnto themſelues another Saint in his roome, at whoſe hands they hoped to finde more fauour. This is an ordinary practiſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; whereof daily experience affoordeth many examples: to wit, of ſuch as haue forſaken Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee did not helpe them in their need, and fled to the Virgin his Mother, as more mercifull and indulgent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this worſe then the heathen Romanes, who though they in all reuerence tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported the tutelar Gods of thoſe Cities and Countries which they conquered into their <hi>Pantheon,</hi> hauing firſt inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and coniured them to forſake their old habitations; yet they did neither renounce, nor with leſſe deuotion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their owne Gods which they had before. But that which is moſt ſtrange of all, hence it muſt needs come to paſſe, that when the Clients of diuers Saints are at oddes and ſtrife, then the Saints whom they haue choſen to bee their Patrones muſt alſo of neceſſity either be at odds for their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or forſake them, or at leaſt one bee ouer-ruled by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo in like maner when one kingdome is at warre

               <p n="5">5. To conclude, though their impiety and Idolatry bee in all theſe reſpects moſt groſſe and palpable; yet all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their abominable blaſphemy in preferring their Saints before Chriſt, or at leaſt in equalling them vnto him: and this will plainely appeare by two practiſes of theirs. Firſt, in that they rely more vpon the mediation and interceſſion of Saints, then vpon the mediation of Chriſt, &amp; therefore direct more prayers, and build more Altars vnto them, then vnto him. And ſecondly, in that after any great benefit receiued or deliuerance obtained, they aſcribe all the honor rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, then vnto Chriſt, as if they were the onely authors and bequeathers thereof. Many and memorious are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this blaſphemy, and ſo ordinary in all places, as with no forehead can be denyed. I will in this purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late onely two famous examples, the firſt whereof is this. After the great battaile at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> wherein <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> being Generall, the Turke receiued ſuch an ouerthrow, as the like he neuer had by Chriſtians before; preſently ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne thankſgiuings and proceſſions were made by Sea and Land to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as to the Goddeſſe of victory; with little or no remembrance of Chriſt Ieſus, who was the onely protector of them in that dangerous expedition. This ſtory is recorded at large in the booke entitled the generall hiſtory of <hi>Spaine.</hi> The ſecond example is of the Spaniſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> in the yeere, 1588. at which time, when the whole Armado was gathered together
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:1279:186"/> and ready to ſet forward, the Generals and great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders aſſembled in a Church of our Lady, gaue her a ſolemne thanks for the victory, which they made themſelues as ſure of, as if it had beene already atchieued: but when they ſaw themſelues diſcomfited, and their Nauy ouerthrowne, thoſe that remained, went to the ſame our Ladies Church, and there not onely expoſtulated with her, but vpbrayded &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled her to her face for her neglect of them. Neither is this any wonder, ſeeing they ſet her vp as the Commandreſſe of her Son, equall her milke to his blood, and offer vp more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of deuotion to her then to him. Howbeit they may ſeeme to haue ſome reaſon for the bleſſed Virgin, becauſe ſhe was Chriſts Mother; but what reaſon haue they for S. <hi>Francis</hi> and Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> whom they not onely equall vnto Chriſt, but in ſome things preferre them before him? For touching Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> marke what they write of him in the booke of his Conformities: <hi>Chriſt made Saint Francis like and conformable to himſelfe in all things.</hi> Againe, in the Mount of <hi>Aluerna,</hi> Friar <hi>Francis</hi> was made one Spirit with God the Father, and his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus. Againe, bleſſed Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had the title of Ieſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> King of the Iewes giuen vnto him. Againe, he obſerued the Law of God literally, and the whole Goſpell to a title. Againe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the <hi>Reuelation, I ſaw another Angell, which had the ſeale of the liuing God, was literally fulfilled in Saint Francis.</hi> Againe, as Chriſt on the day of his death deſcended once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Limbo, and by the vertue of his paſſion releaſed all the ſoules that were found there; ſo Saint <hi>Francis</hi> euery yeere on his birth day went into Purgatory, and carried from thence into Paradiſe all the ſoules of three Orders, to wit; <hi>Minorites,</hi> the Siſters of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> and the <hi>Continentes.</hi> Againe, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer dyed in his habit, could not be damned, and that it was as forcible for remiſſion of ſinnes, as the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Againe, that in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> were renewed the wounds and paſſion of Chriſt for the Redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: that he was giuen for a light to the Gentiles, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſaw his day and reioyced: that hee came out of the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1279:187"/> wound of Chriſts ſide, with the banner of the Croſſe in his hand diſplayed, that as Chriſt was foretold by the Prophets, ſo was Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> as Chriſt had his forerunner, ſo had S. <hi>Francis;</hi> as Chriſt had his Apoſtles whoſe ſound went out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the world, ſo had Saint <hi>Francis:</hi> as Chriſt had his <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene</hi> to waſh his feet, ſo had Saint <hi>Francis:</hi> and as Chriſt had his <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray him, ſo had Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> Laſtly, to omit a number more of ſuch like impieties, as Chriſt was tranſfigured in the Mount, ſo was Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> but with more glory; for vnto Chriſt appeared onely <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> but vnto Saint <hi>Francis</hi> appeared Chriſt, the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, with a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Angels. And thus blaſphemouſly they aduance their Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> in an equall, if not ſuperiour dignity vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Neither is this their blaſphemy any whit inferiour in their <hi>Dominicke.</hi> For when as theſe two Orders of <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes</hi> and <hi>Dominicanes</hi> enuied one anothers greatneſſe, and S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> though firſt in time, yet was behinde in credit to Saint <hi>Francis; Antoninus</hi> a great Archbiſhop, and a <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicane</hi> by ſect, ſtart vp, and labours to exalt his Founder, not onely aboue Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> but euen aboue Chriſt himſelfe: and to that end, thus he writes of him; Chriſt (ſaith he) rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but three dead perſons, but S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> forty: Chriſt being immortall entred twice in vnto his Diſciples the gates being ſhut, but Saint <hi>Dominicke</hi> being yet mortall (which is more wonderfull) entred into the Church when the doores were ſhut, without noiſe, that he might not waken the Friars; and ſo he runnes ouer all Chriſts miracles, and ſtill preferres Saint <hi>Dominicke.</hi> Further the ſame power was giuen to S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> that was vnto Chriſt; for the Angels miniſtred vnto him, the Elements obeyed him, as when the booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his doctrine was throwne into fire, it came out thrice vnhurt, and the deuils trembled at his becke, and refuſed not his command. He was called <hi>Dominicus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quaſi totus domini,</hi> ſo that Chriſt is Lord abſolutely and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, but Saint <hi>Dominick</hi> principally and poſſeſſiuely: Chriſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:1279:187"/> ſaid, <hi>I am the light of the world:</hi> and of S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> the Church ſingeth; <hi>Thou art the light of the world.</hi> All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prophecied of Chriſt, ſo did they of S. <hi>Dominicke:</hi> Chriſt was borne naked, but laid in a Manger by his mother, that the cold might not hurt him: but S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> being an Infant, went out of his bed, and as if hee had hated all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the fleſh, lay often naked vpon the bare earth. When Chriſt was borne, a Starre appeared in the skie, which led the Wiſemen vnto him, and foreſhewed that he ſhould enlighten the world: but when S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> being borne, and was to be Baptized, his mother ſaw a Starre in his fore-head, foretelling, that there was a new light come into the world. Chriſts prayer was alwaies heard of his Father, ſaue once in the Garden, when praying according to his ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he would not be heard according to his reaſon: but S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> was neuer denied any thing that hee prayed for, and conſequently, neuer prayed according to ſenſuality. Chriſt loued vs, and waſhed vs from our ſinnes by his blood, which was ſhed by others: but S. <hi>Dominicke</hi> let out his blood daily with his owne hand, with a three corded chaine; one for his owne ſinnes, which were few; a ſecond, for thoſe that are in Purgatory; &amp; the third, for ſuch as liue in the world. And laſtly, Chriſt being to depart out of this world, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Diſciples the comforter his Spirit: and S. <hi>Dominicke,</hi> when he lay vpon his death-bed, ſaid to his Diſciples, Weepe not for my corporall departure, for I ſhall be more profitable for you in that place whither I go, then I haue bene here; for there I ſhall be a more powerfull Aduocate for you to God, then I could be in this world. Thus he proſecutes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, through all the parts of the life of Chriſt. But thus much I ſuppoſe is ſufficient to demonſtrate the horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their inuocation of Saints. And that no man may thinke theſe be the conceites of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men the booke of S. <hi>Francis</hi> conformities; was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the generall conſent of: the Minorite Friars in their Chapter houſe, and printed at <hi>Beno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A reaſon me thinkes vnanſwerable, conſidering that the credit of all their relikes, dependeth meerely vpon the opinion and report of men, who are ſubiect, both to deceiue, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But no maruaile, if ſuch relikes as theſe were diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed by the warier ſort, ſeeing they croſſe both common ſenſe and reaſon; and imply, not onely an improbability, but alſo an impoſſibility: For touching the breath of Chriſt, what wit of man can giue a reaſon, how it could be encloſed in a box, and kept ſo long a time? And for <hi>Moſes</hi> his hornes, it is apparent that there was no ſuch thing; it aroſe from a groſſe errour of their owne tranſlation, whereas the Text ſaith onely, that the skinne of his face did ſhine, when he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended downe from the holy Mountaine. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.29.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1279:191"/> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alluding thereunto; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. confirmeth the ſame: for he ſaith, that he carried a vaile ouer his fade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly behold the ſame, for the glory of his countenance; but for hornes, not a ſyllable in holy Scripture is to be found; and yet they picture him with a paire of hornes on his forehead, and oſtent the ſame hornes for relikes in their Churches. Neither neede theſe ſeeme ſtrange, ſeeing they want not many others, that are both more ſenſeleſſe and abſurd: as Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Sword and Buckler, wherewith he ouercame the deuill, as if the deuill that is a ſpirit, would be conquered with ſuch wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: the ſound of the bels which hung in <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which a certaine Monke made the world beleeue hee brought from the Eaſt; certaine haires which fell from the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> when hee came to imprint the fiue wounds of Chriſt in Saint <hi>Francis</hi> body: yea, ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſhew the Pilgrimes that go to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a three cornerd ſtone, which they beare them in hand, is that very ſtone whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh in the 118. <hi>Pſalme.

And yet they obtrude theſe relikes, with an infinite number more of the like ſtraine and ſtampe, vpon the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as matters of faith and deuotion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But let me conclude this whole diſcourſe of Relikes, with two moſt famous examples. The firſt whereof is of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1279:192"/> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaines, the one of which (as they ſay) being the chaine wherewith hee was bound at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and brought vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and laid neere vnto the other where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was bound at <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe two chaines reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to ſee one another as two friends, ſo leaped and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that they ceaſed not vntill they embraced each other, and became vnited together, as they remaine at this day in a famous Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> called vpon this occaſion Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ad Vincula.</hi> Another is of the linnen cloth of Saint <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> wherein Chriſt had imprinted the picture of his face; this was carried by <hi>Voluſian</hi> an Embaſſador from <hi>Tiberius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and cured him of his ſickneſſe which the Phyſitians were in deſpaire of: and euer ſince is reſerued at <hi>Rome</hi> for an holy Relike, though a certaine City in <hi>Spaine</hi> doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame alſo, and in both places it is deuoutly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and therefore either the one, or the other, muſt needs be guilty of Idolatry.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1279:192"/> partly touched already in the point of miracles, where their mouing, nodding, ſpeaking, and healing, is diſcouered as counterfeit and falſe; I will here inſiſt onely vpon ſuch things as concerne their very eſſence and being, that their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſuperſtition may be apparent to the whole world. And to begin with their conformity with the Pagans. The Pagans ſay, that ſome of their Images were fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> and ſome made by mens hands. In like manner the Papiſts bragge of ſome of their Images, that they came from heauen, as that of our Lady of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which they ſay was brought downe by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelfe from heauen, accompanied with a band of Angels, and deliuered to three Friars priſoners at <hi>Caire,</hi> and by them tranſported into <hi>France.</hi> And another of our Lady of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> which they ſay was found in an hollow caue of a Mountaine, by the direction of an heauenly light, and the melodious ſinging of Angels that worſhipped it before men euer knew thereof: for theſe people are not content to bee Idolaters themſelues onely, but they would faine make the Angels both Fautors and partakers in the ſame Idolatry. To this kinde may be referred ſuch as they affirme, were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly made, and which they hold in as great eſteeme as if they were fallen from heauen. Amongſt which, that is moſt famous, which they ſay Chriſt Ieſus imprinted on a linnen cloth of S. <hi>Veronica,</hi> of which I made mention before, &amp; which is kept at <hi>Rome</hi> in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, which becauſe it is a renowned Image, behold the whole Legend thereof,<note place="margin">Feriol Locrius. mar. Aug. lib. 5. cap. 4.</note> as it is reported by <hi>Friol de Locres</hi> in the words of <hi>Mathew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter. Tyberius</hi> the Emperor (ſaith hee) being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in his body with the diſeaſe of the Leproſie, it was told him that there was a Phyſitian in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> that healed all diſeaſes with his word, not knowing that the Iewes and <hi>Pilate</hi> had put him to death. He giueth therefore in charge to one <hi>Voluſian</hi> his Friend, to goe preſently to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to command <hi>Pilate</hi> to ſend this Phyſitian vnto him: but <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> hauing receiued the commandement of the Emperor, and being terrified therewith, deſires fourteene daies reſpite:
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:1279:193"/> during the which time, <hi>Voluſian</hi> asking a certaine Matron that he heard had beene familiar with Ieſus called <hi>Veronica,</hi> where he might finde this Phyſitian: ſhe anſwered, alas this was my Lord and my God, whom <hi>Pilate</hi> hath condemned, and cauſed to be crucified through the enuy of his owne Nation the Iewes. Then <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>oluſian</hi> in great griefe ſaid, I am heartily ſorry therefore, ſeeing I ſee I cannot accompliſh my Maſters commandement. But <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eronica</hi> anſwered, when my Lord went vp and downe preaching, and I was depriued of his company, I was deſirous to get his picture drawne; to the end, that when I ſhould bee depriued of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, I might ſolace my ſelfe with the ſight of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: and as I was carrying a linnen cloth to a Painter to haue his picture drawne therein, my Lord met me, and asked me whither I was a going? To whom I hauing declared the cauſe of my voyage, hee asked of me the cloth, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his face therewith, left therein the impreſſion of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable countenance. If therefore thy Maſter looke but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly vpon this picture, hee ſhall preſently recouer his health. <hi>Voluſian</hi> anſwered, Can ſuch a picture be bought for Gold or Siluer? No ſaith <hi>Veronica,</hi> but with an earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of deuotion: and therefore I will goe with thee, and carry to the Emperor the Image to looke vpon, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to mine owne Country. <hi>Voluſian</hi> vpon the credit of this report, returned to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Veronica,</hi> and ſaid to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius, Pilate</hi> and the Iewes haue put this Phyſitian to death whom thou deſiredſt to be brought vnto thee: but a certaine Matron is come with mee, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with her his picture, which if thou lookeſt vpon deuoutly, thou ſhalt be cured of thy diſeaſe.

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:1279:195"/> this Image ſtands, is alwaies full of Snow, as they report: ſome againe take their names from the ſuppoſed effects, which they are thought to worke: as our Lady of Recouery, our Lady of Comfort, our Lady of Gladneſſe, our Lady of Ioy, our Lady of Pitty, our Lady of Vertue, our Lady of good Newes, our Lady of good Deſire, our Lady of Aydes, with an infinite number of the like kinde: So that we may iuſtly ſay of theſe Papiſts, as the Lord himſelfe ſaith of the <hi>Iewes</hi> by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 11.13. <hi>O Iudah according to the number of thy Cities were thy Gods, and according to the number of the ſtreets of Ieruſalem, haue ye ſet vp Altars to that ſhamefull thing, euen Altars to burne incenſe vnto Baal.</hi> A prophecy verified in the Popiſh Church, where they haue a ſeuerall Saint for euery City, and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a common protectrix of them all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But this is not all: the differences that are betwixt theſe our Ladies are very great, aſwell in other things, as in their names; and that both in their age, and in their feature, and in their beauty, and their countenance; as <hi>Henry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> in his Apology for <hi>Herodotus,</hi> hath at large deſcribed: but in this lurkes the maine poyſon (ſaith the ſame Author) that for the moſt part they are acoutred and garniſhed both in countenance and veſture, like notorious Harlots; as they vſed to paint S. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> to wit, naked in ſome parts, as alſo the <hi>Aegyptian Mary.</hi> And to this purpoſe I remember (ſaith he) what I haue read of our Lady of all beauties at <hi>Tours,</hi> ſo tearmed becauſe ſhe vſed to be painted after the ſame manner that <hi>Venus</hi> was wont to be among the Pagans: For all the daintieſt Wenches of <hi>Tours</hi> were brought before the Painter; and from one he borrowed her high forehead, from another her ſparkling eyes, from a third her pretty long noſe, from a fourth her ſmiling mouth, from others a dimpled chin, and other parts of the body: now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the obiect of ſo beautifull an our Lady, enkindleth our deuotion or no, or rather what other flame it ſtirreth vp, I leaue to them that are competent iudges in this kinde.

                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:1279:196"/> a great preacher in thoſe times, that there are in their bookes of deuotion, to be ſeene moſt laſciuious pictures, fitter to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But whether thoſe pictures were of ſuch as they had at command, or of ſuch as they would haue at command, I know not: onely it is likely they were of ſuch creatures, as to whom they bore great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and leaſt they ſhould forget them, would contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate their pictures in their prayers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now I would aske them in this ſubiect but one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to wit, Whether all theſe our Ladies which I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are one and the ſame in ſubſtance, or diuers and many? If they ſay, One and the ſame, I aske then why they diſguiſe her after ſo many faſhions? If they ſay that they are diuers, I would faine know of them, which is the true Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Ieſus Chriſt? This queſtion which way ſoeuer they anſwer, caſts them into moſt foule and groſſe abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore I leaue it to their wiſedomes to reſolue: onely let me remember them of the opinion of a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Mount Riuard</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who ſaide, that our Lady of <hi>Nautueil,</hi> and our Lady of <hi>Francucil</hi> were Siſters, and ſurely ſhe had reaſon, ſeeing their habits and countenances were ſomewhat alike.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But this abuſe is not onely in the habits of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but alſo of the other Saints, which to decipher to the full, would aske a longer diſcourſe then I intend; and for which, I referre the Reader to the former Author, <hi>Henry Stephen.</hi> Indeed the differences betwixt them, is both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, and incredible; not onely in theſe things, but in many others; and therefore it is a great wonder how they being ſo different betweene themſelues, ſhould haue ſo perfect an harmony in the kitchins of their holy Church, which they all with one accord maintaine in ſuch ſort, that they hardly giue place to the kitchins of Kings and Emperours. Much reuenew commeth to them from the bodies of their Saints departed, in regard of their relikes, as hath bene declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but it is nothing to that wealth which they gaine by their ſoules: which that we may beleeue to be true, let the

               <p n="1">1. BEſides all theſe forenamed deluſions, the world hath bene no leſſe inueigled and deceiued by their vſe, or rather abuſe of the Keyes, which the Pope challengeth, to haue authority to diſpoſe in the Church, and ſublegateth the ſame to Biſhops and Prieſts. This power is exerciſed two waies: either by ſhutting whom they liſt out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, by excommunication: or by ſetting open the dore to whom they liſt, by Pardons, Indulgences, and Abſolution. Now their Excommunication is twofold, the leſſer and the greater: the leſſer is nothing elſe but an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Sacraments of the Church: and the greater called <hi>Anathema,</hi> an vtter abſciſſion from the body of Chriſt. And in like manner their Indulgences are of two kinds: one Sacramentall after the Sacrament of Confeſſion and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is an abſolution from ſinnes: and the other Iuridicall, which is an act of iuriſdiction and Eccleſiaſticall authority, giuing abſolution from the cenſures of the Church: now how both theſe are abuſed, and the world deluded by them, is the point I am to manifeſt in this diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And firſt, I ſay that this power left to the Church by Chriſt, is in many things ſo aviled by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in others ſo exalted aboue meaſure, that there remaines
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:1279:197"/> little in it of the inſtitution of the Sonne of God. This is a formall abuſe, and one of the feſtered vlcers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which requireth a fuller Treatiſe to lanch the ſore thereof, then my intent will allow: I will onely ſearch it a little, though not to the bottome. And to begin, obſerue firſt, how the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the 15. Seſſion, and Chapter 3. of the reformation, ſeemeth willing to put it hand to the correction of the abuſes of Eccleſiaſticall cenſures: but all that thoſe holy Fathers do, is nothing elſe but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the authority of Biſhops, and to abaſe that of Prieſts, and to clip the wings of the ſecular Magiſtrate. Secondly, the forme of their Sacramentall abſolution, which is in the Prieſts power to giue, is vtterly full of blaſphemy; for they doe not onely abſolue in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, which is agreeable to Chriſts inſtitution, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the name and merits of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>

Thirdly, this abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is giuen vpon condition, that the ſinner ſhall endure ſome ſatisfactory paines impoſed vpon him by the Prieſt, as ſome Faſts, ſome certaine Pilgrimages, ſome certaine number of Prayers; which laſt ſeemeth to me a groſſe abuſe, to put prayers amongſt paines, ſeeing good workes cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led paines or puniſhments, it being a greater puniſhment to be forbidden them, then commanded. Fourthly, (which is yet worſe) if a man being enioyned this penance haue no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to faſt and pray, or go on pilgrimage, he may redeeme all with a little money, and permute this affliction of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, into the affliction of his purſe.<note place="margin">Can presbiter D ſt. 82.</note> This their owne Canon affirmeth expreſſely.

And becauſe I haue mentioned their Indulgences, which are an extrauagant kinde of exerciſe of the Keyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meerely ſacramentall, nor iuridicall, but of a mixt nature partaking of both: let vs in few words obſerue their abuſe of the world by them; and that ſo groſſe and palpable, as is almoſt incredible, were it not fore-prophecied of them by the Apoſtle, that God ſhould ſend vpon them ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to beleeue lyes. This power the Pope challengeth to himſelfe alone: for he (ſay they) being Chriſts Vicar here or earth, hath the keyes of the Churches treaſury tyed to his girdle, which treaſury is filled with the merits of the Saints, to wit, their workes of ſupererogation, which they haue more then they neede for their owne ſaluation, mixt with the merits of Chriſt, and all theſe to be diſpenſed and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the Popes pleaſure. By this power the Pope can at an inſtant, deliuer all the ſoules that are in Purgatory, and ſend
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:1279:198"/> them into Paradiſe: which if it be true, then it followeth, that if he can do this and will not, he is an vnmercifull Tyrant, in ſuffering ſo many millions of ſoules to lye frying in that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, when it is in his power to giue them eaſe: if he will and cannot, then hee is a notorious lyer to vaunt of this power. By this ſame power, he taketh vpon him to giue pardons to thoſe that are aliue, and to exempt them from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſinnes by plenary remiſſion: but it is with this condition, <hi>Si non ponatur obex, If there be not a barre in the receiuer;</hi> which barre is want of Faith and Repentance: but this is a moſt intollerable abuſe, for if a man haue faith and repentance, he is ſure to be ſaued, whether he haue the Popes pardon or no: and if he want faith and repentance, they themſelues confeſſe that the Popes pardon can doe him no good. By this power, they promiſe plenary remiſſion of ſinnes, to all that come to <hi>Rome</hi> on Pilgrimage, and chaunce to dye by the way, and to them that liue and viſit the holy places there, eſpecially the ſeuen priuiledged Churches. They promiſe to ſome 50. to ſome an 100. to ſome 3000. yeeres of pardon: yea <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight granted out of his bountifull liberality 82000. yeeres pardon, to euery one that ſhould ſay a prayer of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> printed in a Table at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> and that <hi>toties quoties.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. granted 20. yeeres pardon to euery one that doth but bow his head at the naming of Ieſus: by which account, a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide in one day for millions of Ages, and, that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, beyond the worlds continuance; whereas Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory laſteth according to their opinion, but till the day of iudgement. By this power, the Pope vſeth to conſecrate and hallow an infinite number of Crucifixes, Medailes, and <hi>Agnus Deis,</hi> holy Graines, or Beades, and ſuch like traſh, and to ſend them abroad into the world, that whoſoeuer weareth one of them about him, if he be at the point of death, and ſay but in his heart the name Ieſus, ſhall haue an abſolute forgiueneſſe of all his ſinnes, though he cannot be partaker of the other Sacraments of their Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For hereby not onely notorious ſinners, as Whores, Theeues, Adulterers, Murtherers, &amp;c. are made ſecure and careleſſe in their ſinnes, ſeeing a pardon is ſo eaſily to be obtained, but they are alſo enboldened to continue in their ſinfull courſes; foraſmuch as they vſe to pardon a ſinne before it be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as it is ſaid of Doctor <hi>Party,</hi> that he brought with him his pardon in his pocket, for murthering our late Queene of happy memory, intended by him: and a certaine <hi>Germane,</hi> hauing obtained a pardon for the next ſinne he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, robbed preſently the Popes Pardoner, and ſo could not be accuſed thereof, becauſe he had his pardon to ſhew.

But moſt pregnant is the complaint of the <hi>Germaine</hi> Nation in the booke of their <hi>Centum grauamina,</hi> exhibited to the Popes Legate at <hi>Norimberge, An.</hi> 1522. for there they thus complaine. <hi>By the ſale and Merchandize of this ware,</hi> (namely Pardons) <hi>not onely Germany is spoiled of money, but Chriſtian godlineſſe is extinguiſhed: for from hence Whoredome, Inceſt, Adultery, Periury, Murder, Theft, Robbery, Vſury, and a whole heape of miſchiefes haue preceeded, no man being afraid to commit any ſinne in respect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when he was perſwaded that a pardon might be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at ſo eaſie a price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But enough of this traſh, wherein peraduenture I haue ſtayed too long: I come now to their Excommunications, which containe in it ſo many abuſes as is hard to count them. For whereas the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures were admitted to humble ſinners, and ſo to bring them to repentance, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> turnes them quite to another end: For they make them ſerue for the finding out of things loſt, and the payment of deſperate debts, and for terrifying from ſinnes not yet committed, ſo laying a plaiſter where there is no wound. For the firſt: if a man haue an Horſe ſtollen from him, or any other thing, he may procure an Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the party that had ſtole him though vnknowne, to be of force if he bring him not againe, and ſo the Theefe muſt either gallop away to hell, or returne to the Gallowes, let him chooſe which: and ſo oftentimes it falleth out, that by this meanes, a Father hath vnwittingly excommunicated his owne Son, and for the body of an Horſe,<note place="margin">Tollet de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct. Sacord. lib. 1. cap 8. Concil. Trident. ſeſſ. 25.</note> ſent his Sonnes ſoule to the deuill. Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> approueth of this kinde of Excommunication, and ſo doth the Councill of <hi>Trent.</hi> In like maner, the ſame Cardinall alloweth, that an Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1279:200"/> may be publikely denounced againſt all ſuch, as ſhall rob ſuch a Lords Orchard, or ſteale his Kine, this is for a fault committed. And if a Creditor be deſirous to be ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paide his debt, he may by their rules excommunicate the Debtor before hand, if hee come not to giue ſatisfaction within a prefixed time. And this is the vſe they make of the power of the Keyes, giuen by our Sauiour Chriſt to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for the ſaluation and humiliation of ſinners.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But moſt pernitious is their common rule that a man excommunicate, is ſuſpended from the charge and office he beareth whatſoeuer it bee, and can exerciſe no act of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which is not voide in Law: for this is to ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Pope and his Biſhops, all ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, all the offices of the Crowne, all the Lords of the Councill, yea the very Crownes of Kings themſelues, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once an Excommunication is darted againſt them, be it wrong or right, are depriued of all authority, and all their Edicts, Ordinances, and Decrees, made vtterly voide and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled. And yet their interdict of a whole Kingdome for an offence conceiued againſt the King onely, is a matter of greater horror and deteſtation: for then no Bell is ſuffered to be rung in the whole Land, all Diuine ſeruice ceaſeth, hee that would heare a Maſſe muſt goe out of the Land, all the Sacraments of the Church are ſuſpended, except Baptiſme, auricular confeſſion and extreame Vnction: the bodies of the dead are buried in the fields, and all Church-yardes ſhut vp. In this miſerable caſe was our <hi>England</hi> vnder King <hi>Iohn</hi> for the ſpace of ſix yeeres, during all which time, how many ſoules were ſent into hell (if we beleeue the Pope) as men dying out of the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> And all this for pecuniary quarrels, and certaine temporall rights, which the King denied to the Pope, the people being not the cauſe thereof. But yet it is moſt abominable of all, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes is giuen as the wages of iniquity, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to a ſinner vpon condition that he giue his Houſe, or his Land, or his Kingdome to the Pope, for the wages of iniquity: as when hauing excommunicated one Prince, hee
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1279:200"/> giueth his Dominion to another vpon condition he ſhould inuade and ſacke the others Country, and diſpoſſeſſe him thereof. This is a common practiſe of the Pope againſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and Kings, as the ſtories of the Emperor <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, and his ſonne <hi>Conrade,</hi> with diuers of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Kings ſufficiently witneſſe. And in <hi>France</hi> during the laſt league, were there not pardons ſet vp in all the principall Cities of the Kingdome, wherein nine yeeres remiſſion was granted to euery one that ſhould rebell againſt the King? as if he ſhould ſay, becauſe thou art wicked, therefore thou ſhalt be ſaued: becauſe thou art a Traytor, therefore thou ſhalt haue remiſſion of thy ſinnes, and the kingdome of heauen. And as touching the rauiſhing of mens goods by this meanes, the caſe is ſo cleare by manifold experience, that it admits no deny all; for during the 300. yeeres wherein the Pope quarrelled with the Emperors of <hi>Germany,</hi> (for ſo long that quarrell continued) did not the power of the Pope en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and that of the Emperor decreaſe euery day?

But it is pretty which <hi>Bellarmine, Sa,</hi> and <hi>Nauarre</hi> affirme, that hee which giueth Indulgences to others, may alſo giue them to himſelfe, and ſo there can be no want of pardon, when a man may pardon himſelfe: and yet Maſſe is ſaid for the Pope departed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing that he is in Purgatory, and that he cannot pardon himſelfe.

And I hope wee haue thouſands that are of the ſame minde with a Pariſian Prieſt, who hauing receiued an Excommunication againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, which was to bee publiſhed with ſound of Bels, and Candles lighted, and after extinct, thus anſwered: <hi>I am commanded to excommunicate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Fredericke, and not knowing the cauſe, yet knowing that there are great quarrels and an irreconciliable hatred betwixt the Pope and him, and I know that one doth wrong to the other, but which it is I know not: therefore as farre as my power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, I excommunicate him that doth the wrong, whetherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee be, and abſolue him that it is done vnto.</hi>

For touching Pardons, it hath beene ſufficiently declared before: and for Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, their ordinary practiſe was to excommunicate, to the end, that an abſolution might be purchaſed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">See theſe things more fully diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi> in his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patus.

                  </note> as the forenamed <hi>Fredericke</hi> bought his abſolution of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, for an 100000. ounces of Gold. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight in the higheſt degree of impiety, was not content to excommunicate the French King <hi>Phillip</hi> after the ordinary manner, but together with him, all his, to the fourth generation. Is not this a manifeſt trampling vpon the necke of Kings, and abuſing of the blindnes of the world? For what appearance is there that any mortall man hath power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a man and all his poſterity to the fourth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? The ſame Pope in deſpite of the forenamed French King, diſanulled all the Indulgences giuen by his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to Frenchmen: a moſt ſtrange and abſurd act: for if theſe Indulgences were of that vertue as they pretend, they muſt haue redeemed out of Purgatory millions of ſoules; and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:1279:202"/> if they were by this Decree nullified, then it muſt needs follow, that theſe poore ſoules muſt returne backe againe out of Paradiſe into Purgatory: this concluſion is an <hi>Amphiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boena</hi> which ſtingeth both waies.

               <p n="9">9. To conclude, with this thunder and lightning from the Popes ſeate (for ſo it is named by themſelues) men were ſo terrified, that they were driuen into courſes of extremitie and deſperation: for they were perſwaded that they were hereby giuen ouer to the power of Sathan, and vtterly depriued of the protection of God, and his holy Angels, and of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.<note place="margin">Menot. Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. fol. 143. Col. 4.</note> And therefore one of their owne Friars ſaith, that it is not fit that this dart ſhould be put into the hands of euery fooliſh Prelate, which notwithſtanding is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope lending to Biſhops and Prieſts this thunderbolt, as often as occaſion requireth. And this is the more remarkeable, ſeeing ſuch as are excommunicate are depriued not onely of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints for the preſent, but of the very prayers of the Church for the future. For on good-Friday when they pray for Iewes, Turkes, and Pagans, yet they pray not for theſe. Howbeit ſince the light of the Goſpell began to ſhine in the firmament of the Church, the world is growne a little wiſer, and theſe thunderclaps are as much now contemned, as they were before reuered: yea, many of their owne Religion haue caſt off the terror of them, and ſot them at naught. Take for example the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, who was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fauourer, but a protector of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> this man being menaced with an Excommunication by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, if he did not deliuer vp the City <hi>Plaiſance</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, gaue him to know by his Embaſſador, that if he thundred and lightned with his Excommunications, hee would anſwere him with the thunder and lightning of his Artillery. Their diuelliſh pollicy therefore being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, they fell to other more violent courſes, as the fire and faggots, the bloody Inquiſition, the burning chamber,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1279:203"/> open warres, ſecret treaſons, ſword, gun-powder, dagge, piſtoll, and poyſon, maſſacres, murders, with all manner of more then <hi>Nero</hi>-like cruelty, and all too little to maintaine their abominable pompe and ſuperſtition. Theſe are now the engines of their policy, the old ſpirituall cenſures being almoſt out of date, and by theſe they labour both to vphold their <hi>Babel,</hi> and to ouerturne the truth. But our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen to the cinders of his bleſſed Martyrs, the vertue which is ſaid to be in the aſhes of the Phoenix, and that with more abundance: for the aſhes of a Phoenix bring forth but one Phoenix; but the aſhes of one faithfull Seruant of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, hath ingendred an infinite number of the ſame kinde, who notwithſtanding all their cruelties and bloody executions, do, and will ſtand for the defence of the truth, and more and more diſcouer the abominations of that purple Whore.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THeir Monaſticall Vowes and Sacraments lye ſo in my way, that I cannot draw towards my concluſion, vntill I a little diſcouer how the world hath bene deluded by thoſe meanes. And touching their Vowes, they are of three ſorts. Firſt, the Vow of voluntary pouerty. Secondly, of celibacy or ſingle life. And thirdly, of blinde and regular obedience: all which are profeſſed by their Monkes and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars in their Cloiſters, to the great abuſing of the world by theſe tricks of Antichriſtian policy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning their voluntary pouerty which they vow and profeſſe, who ſeeth not how by this tricke they haue made themſelues rich and mighty vpon earth? they profeſſe to haue nothing, and thereby gaine all things that their hearts can deſire, and that in ſuch plenty and abundance, that the very fat of the earth is their portion.

Monaſteries (ſaith one of their owne writers) were founded in time paſt for Deuotion, though now they are abuſed to rapine and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe: for they haue at this day deſtroyed the world, and brought to nothing the ſtate of the Empire and of all Lay-men: wherefore all ſuch places as are, or ſhall be erected, may worthily bee called nets framed to catch Lay-mens goods. In this ſmall land of <hi>England,</hi> the reuenues of the Religious houſes which were diſſolued, did ariſe according to the old rents, to the ſumme of an hundred thirty foure thouſand ſix hundred and three pounds two ſhillings foure pence halfe peny: which ſumme what it would amount vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the true valew according to the eſteeme of theſe times, I leaue to them to calculate that are better ſeene in wordly matters then my ſelfe: my opinion is, that it is not the tenth of the true valew. The Votaries of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Order, of all other, profeſſed pouerty in the higheſt degree: according to the rule of their Order they might not ſo much as touch any Gold or Siluer, neither had they any right, title, or intereſt in any thing to be their owne: their good Founder <hi>Francis</hi> hauing laide it downe, that without any conſtruction, gloſſe, or interpretation, they ſhould haue nothing of their owne. And yet theſe Hypocrites wil take as much Gold or Siluer as is giuen them with their Gloues on their hands, and liue poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of great reuenues, and fare plentifully in their Cloiſters: like vnto that melancholy <hi>Athenian</hi> that imagined all the ſhips and goods in the Port <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I would faine know how they can excuſe themſelues by this rule from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theeues. For (as <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> ſaith) what is he but a theefe,<note place="margin">Hoſpinian. de orig. Monach. lib. 6. cap. 16.</note> that eateth and drinketh, and clotheth himſelfe with that that

As if it were likely, that our Sauiour would at the firſt daſh giue a counſell of perfection to one that was not yet conuerted to the faith of Chriſt, but was meerely of the Iewiſh Religion: or if he did, yet that theſe fellowes are aſcended to this degree of perfection, when by their giuing away all (as they ſay) they gaine more then all, more caſe, plenty, belly-cheare, wealth, and contentment, then they could haue if they had kept their owne in their hands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their vow of celebacy or ſingle life is of like quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nature: for vnder the pretext of holineſſe and purity, the Cleargy of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſed all manner of filthineſſe and impurity. So groſſely was the world deluded by this their counterfeit ſanctity, that if a Prieſt was found in bed with another mans wife, yet he was not to be ſuſpected of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane act, but to be thought onely to counſaile and aduiſe her for her ſoules health: and yet the horrible adulteries, and Sodomiticall abominations which haue ſprung from this root of celibacy, are vncountable.

This and much more of ſuch ſtuffe is found in his Legend, which was read in the Church on his feſtiuall day with great deuotion, and certainely beleeued by the blinded multitude.

For they are guarded with the priuiledges of the Romane Church, and exempted from the iuriſdiction of all other Churches: and therefore though they may call others in queſtion in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Court of Iuſtice, they if they haue done wrong cannot be met withall but at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Foxes they are in ſheepes skins, ſo diſſembling their Art of fraud, that they ſeeme to profeſſe nothing but counterfeit hypocriſie, and pure gaine, vnder the colour of piety: whilſt with a pale countenance they faine to faſt, and draw deepe ſighes from their breſt, with teares at command and murmure continuall prayers with mouing lips, and by a compoſed geſture, ſober gate, deiected eyes, ſeeme moſt humble and meeke, when in truth if they bee looked into, no ſinke is more filthy and corrupt: and yet they ouercome all with the title of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defend themſelues with their hood, as with a buckler againſt all the darts of Fortune, and ſo being ſecure from worldly troubles and dangers, eate the bread of idleneſſe, and ſleepe in deepe ſecurity; and account this Euangelicall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, to eate the fruit of others mens labours, and liue by the

Though I ſay, they teach this in their bookes, notwithſtanding they terrifie the people in their Sermons, that they muſt be greatly humbled, and rend their hearts by contrition, if they will be ſaued (for it is to be noted, that Popery is one thing in their books, and another in their common practiſe and ſpeech:) and that which is moſt abſurd of all, they neede not to be contrite at all, if they will giue a little money for a Pardon, and yet goe to heauen too. Touching Confeſſion, what is it but a meete deuice of pollicy to drayne mens purſes, and to diue into their purpoſes? Hereby they ſearch into the Counſailes of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1279:208"/> Princes, and myſteries of State, and intentions and practiſes of the common ſort of people; and ſo frame and proportion their plots accordingly, and that many times for the ruine and deſtruction of whole States. For if they finde any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuouſly minded againſt Hereticall Princes, as they tearme all that proteſt againſt the corruption of their religion; they not onely giue them abſolution from their intended crime before it be committed, but euen animate them vnto it with promiſe of Paradiſe, and commendation of an act, not onely meritorious, but Heroicall. Thus Father <hi>Garnet</hi> confeſſed our Powder Traytors; and a Ieſuite, <hi>Rauillac,</hi> that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the <hi>French</hi> King: and yet forſooth the ſeale of ſecrecy ſolemnly ſworne, but daily broken for aduantage, doth caſt a vizard of holyneſſe vpon their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. Beſides it is a knowne caſe, how moſt of that ſhorne generation, make their confeſſion an ordinary bawde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.

Iuder ſalut. lib. 6. cap. 16.</note> that it was a good prouiſion if the obligation of ſecret confeſſions were vtterly taken away, for the preuentions of moſt abhominable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and filthy acts, in likelihood to be committed by ſuch as were forbidden the vſe of marriage. What is this but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of holineſſe, to open a gap to all wickedneſſe and vncleanneſſe? As for their ſatisfaction, which is the laſt part of their Sacrament of Penance, that is clearly nothing elſe but a Pageant of hypocriſie, and a meere mockery: For firſt, whatſoeuer paine is enioyned them by their Confeſſour in recompence (as they ſay) for their ſinne, is for the moſt part ſo ſleight and eaſiy (to wit, ſaying ſo many Creeds, or Auces, going in Pilgrimage to ſuch or ſuch a Saint, giuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a few ſtripes on the backe with a whip, faſting a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number of daies, &amp;c.) as a wicked man would hardly exchange his long pleaſure in ſinne, for ſo ſmall and ſhort a puniſhment. And ſecondly, let the Penance enioyned bee neuer ſo ſharpe and great, yet a pardon may releaſe it, and that may be obtained by a little money; or if money bee wanting, for viſiting one of the ſeauen Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſaying a ſhort praier in the Primer, or deuoutly worſhipping the Croſſe, Nailes, Whip, Launce, Heart, or Handes, of Chriſt painted on a wall. Yea thirdly, if we are not able or willing to performe our penance our ſelues, we may hire an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to do it for vs, and in our ſtead, which is the plaine doctrine of <hi>Tollet,</hi> as hath bene ſhewed before. And what is all this, but a May-game of ſport, and a meere mocking of the world? by which notwithſtanding they both keepe the people, yea and Princes too, in awe and ſubiection, and heap vp great treaſures into their coffers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From their Sacrament of Penance, I deſcend to the other foure. And firſt of Confirmation, which as it is abuſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is nothing elſe but a deuice to gaine
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:1279:209"/> reuerence and reſpect to their Biſhops aboue other Prieſts. For hence it is, that they preferre it before Baptiſme, which they ſay euery ordinary Prieſt may conferre, but this onely be performed by a Biſhop, and that a man hath not his full Chriſtendome, till he be <hi>Chryſmatus,</hi> that is, thus comfir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and the Biſhops bleſſing is ſo donatiue of ſauing grace <hi>ex opere oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to,</hi> that if a man dye before he hath committed any mortall ſinne after it, he muſt of neceſſity go to heauen. Hence it was, that yong &amp; old flocked vnto them by troups on euery ſide, kneeling on their knees as to ſome Saint come from heauen, and crauing their benediction with moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deuotion, and yet in concluſion all was not worth a ruſh, but they returned home as empty of grace as they went thither. I know that this Ceremony is of great Antiquity, and hath an holy and commendable vſe in the Church of God: but that it ſhould be a Sacrament conferring grace, and that a man is not a perfect Chriſtian without it, is a moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable deluſion.</p>
               <p>Marriage is the next, which they call a Sacrament, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto it the very efficacy of ſauing grace, as to the reſt, and yet deny the vſe of it to their Prieſts: before a vow (ſay they) it is <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> a Sacrament; after a vow <hi>Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> ſacriledge. Now if it be a Sacrament, why is it not common to all? Why may any man vow againſt it? Why do they barre their Prieſts of it, who of all other haue a right vnto the Sacraments? Will they deny them the meanes of their ſaluation, and ſo make them vngracious as they are? But I meane not to diſpute the queſtion any further, ſaue onely to ſhew how theſe fellowes haue deceiued the world with a pretence of piety, in calling this ordinance of God a Sacrament of grace, and yet deny it to their Cleargy as a ſinne of the fleſh, and preferring concubinage, adultery, and whoredome, before it, as leſſer euils.</p>
               <p>I will put in the next place, their extreame Vnction, though it be laſt in order, and ſay onely thus much of it, that if it be true which the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> decreed,<note place="margin">Concil.

For Purgatory, ſay they, is ordained to purge away the relikes of ſinne which in our life time we haue not ſatisfied for:<note place="margin">Idem de Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. lib. 1. c. 1. et lib. 2. c. 1</note> thus <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> defineth Purgatory, <hi>To be a place, wherein as it were in a priſon, thoſe ſoules are purged which were not ſufficiently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this life, to the end that being ſo purged, they may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into heauen.</hi> Now if all the relikes of ſinne be wiped away by this extreame vnction, then what vſe is there of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory? And if the relikes of ſinne be to be purged in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, then what vſe of this Sacrament? Either therefore the one, or the other, is a meere deluſion, or rather both, ſeeing there is no purgation of ſinne, but by the blood and Spirit of Chriſt alone, by which as many as beleeue in him are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and clenſed from the very dregges of corruption, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.7. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.

                  <hi>CHAP. 8.</hi> A rabble of other Romiſh Deluſions, ariſing principally from the ignorance and abuſe of holy Scripture.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TO avoyde tediouſneſſe in this ſubiect which is infinite, I will binde vp in one bundle a few more of their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whereby the Popiſh Prieſts haue abuſed the world, and thoſe principally which ariſe, either from the ignorance, or from the malicious abuſing of holy Scripture, or from both together as ioynt cauſes. The ignorance and ſottiſhneſſe of the Romiſh Cleargy in former times, is ſo notorious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that it is almoſt a needleſſe thing to report that which is written of them. Their owne rule, that Ignorance is the mother of deuotion, though directed to the Laity, yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Cleargy alſo: by which they were encouraged to lay aſide all ſtudy of holy Scripture, and to addict themſelues to blinde and ſuperſtitious deuotion, the true daughter of their blind mother Ignorance. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath two daughters, dubiety or doubting, and falſity or errour: their deuotion then muſt either be full of doubts, as proceeding from vnknowne grounds, or of errour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from authorized ignorance of holy Scripture. There is one Ancient Law in our Kingdome, hatcht in the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Popery, that plainely euinceth the ignorance of the Cleargy in thoſe times, and their want of learned men: It is this, that in many criminall offences, he that could but reade the Pſalme <hi>Miſerere,</hi> or ſome other, though he vnderſtood neuer a word thereof, ſhould be exempted from the ſecular power, as being fit to make a Clerke, which plainly argued that which I named before, the groſſe ignorance of the greateſt part of the Cleargy in thoſe daies. I confeſſe that
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:1279:211"/> this Law is ſtill continued, but it is not with opinion that ſuch perſons are fit to be made Prieſts, but onely for mitigating of the rigour of the Law in petty offences, which otherwiſe would be inflicted on them as vpon the greateſt. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire particular examples of this ſottiſhneſſe in Popiſh Prieſts, I could referre the Reader to other Authors that haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereof, and eſpecially to <hi>Stephens Apology</hi> for <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> where is a whole thraue of them: but that he may haue alſo heere ſome ſatisfaction, I will not forbeare to relate ſome of them, partly out of that booke, and partly out of other writers. Their owne Canon Law telleth vs of a Prieſt, that in the Sacrament of Baptiſme vſed theſe words, <hi>Bapizote in nomine patria, et filia, et spiritua ſancta,</hi> which notwithſtanding Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> writing to one <hi>Boniface</hi> a Biſhop in whoſe Dioceſſe this abſurdity was committed,<note place="margin">Decret. <hi>3.</hi> p. de conſecrat.

Another read <hi>Demiſſus per portam,</hi> let downe by the gate, in ſtead of <hi>Demiſſus per sportam,</hi> let downe by a basket. <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.25.

I will not remember that Popiſh Prieſt in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne, who reading the firſt Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Goſpell in the Church, <hi>Abraham</hi> begate <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> begate <hi>Iacob, &amp;c.</hi> when he came to the hard names of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minadab</hi> and <hi>Naaſſon, &amp;c.</hi> brake off on a ſudaine, not being able to read any further, with this concluſion, <hi>And ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate one another to the end of the Chapter.</hi> Neither will I ſpeake of him a Popiſh Prieſt alſo miniſtrified in that time; that read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.27. in ſtead of <hi>caſt an Angle into the Sea, caſt an Angell into the Sea:</hi> nor him that being by his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary bidden to conſtrue this Article of the Creed, <hi>Paſſus eſt ſub Pontio Pilato</hi> to try his ſufficiency, anſwered thus, <hi>Paſſus eſt, he paſſed, ſub Pontio Pilato, ouer the bridge Pilatum:</hi> which the Biſhop finding fault withall, ſaying, that <hi>Sub</hi> ſignified <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> not <hi>ouer,</hi> he replyed; but if hee had gone vnder hee had beene drowned. But to paſſe further, if their ignorance in the Latine was ſo great, what ſhall we thinke of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Hebrew and Greeke?

So the word <hi>Cephas,</hi> which is a Syriacke word ſignifying a ſtone, ſome of them deriue from the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1279:212"/> French or Engliſh word <hi>Chef</hi> or <hi>Cheefe,</hi> and others from the Latine word <hi>Caput,</hi> which comes from <hi>Capio,</hi> whoſe preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect tence is <hi>Copi:</hi> and all this doltiſh ſtirre is to vphold the Popes ſupremacy that he ſhould bee head of the Church. But it is no maruaile if they thus dealt with thoſe three holy Languages, ſanctified by the Croſſe of Chriſt, ſeeing in their opinion the knowledge of them was a manifeſt introduction into Lutheraniſme, which they call hereſie, but in truth is a meanes to diſcouer their errors, and lay them open to the world. Neither was this ignorance found onely in ordinary Prieſts, but euen in Biſhops and Popes: as witneſſeth <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus de Caſtro. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>ad haereſ.</hi> when he ſaith; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat plures corum adeo illiteratos eſſe, vt Gramaticam penitus ignorant.</hi> It is well knowne, that many of them are ſo vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they know not their Grammer rules: for example, a Biſhop examining one that was to be made Deacon, in ſtead of asking <hi>Quot ſunt Sacramenta,</hi> demanded <hi>quot ſuni</hi> 7 <hi>Sacramenta:</hi> how many are the ſeuen Sacraments? To whom the Deacon anſwering, <hi>Tres:</hi> the Biſhop replyed <hi>In quibus,</hi> what call you them? And it is reported of Pope <hi>Iunius</hi> the ſecond, that ſigning a Warrant, in ſtead of <hi>fiat</hi> hee wrote <hi>fiatur.</hi> If any ſhould here ſtep vp and ſay, that wee haue alſo amongſt vs many ignorant Miniſters, that haue beene as abſurd in their preachings and demeanors: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that there neuer was Church better furniſhed with able, learned, and godly Preachers, then ours is (the Lords name be praiſed for it:) howbeit I deny not, but that there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs many wandring ſtarres, lewde, and vnlearned. Miniſters, who in their preachings and ſayings may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture abuſe their calling, and affoord matter of laughter to prophane and ſuperſtitious perſons: but notwithſtanding I auouch, firſt, that the number of them is but ſmall, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the huge troopes of ignorant Prieſts and Friars which ſwarme in al the places of Popery like Locuſts in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And ſecondly, that our Church is ſicke of them, and ſeekes to eaſe her ſtomach of ſuch vnſauory morſels by little and little, not countenancing them and their ignorance, as
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1279:213"/> they doe in the Romiſh Synagogue. And thirdly, that ſuch abuſes in ſome of our Cleargy are matters meerely taken vp by report, and often deuiſed by Popiſh and irreligious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in malice to our Religion, without any ground of truth: whereas thoſe things which are related of them, are either authentically regiſtred in their owne bookes, or divulged by men of their owne faction and Religion. And therefore I may truely make vſe of the ſaying of the Poet againſt them: <hi>Et ſi not digniſumus hac contumelia maxime, indigni illi qui dicant tamen.</hi> Howſoeuer, the whole world will confeſſe, that the times of Popery were times of blindneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, both in Cleargy and Layty, and that when the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell began againe to ſhine forth in the world, Learning alſo began to ſhew it ſelfe in all places, which before had lyen hid as it were in a dungeon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus they abuſed the world by their ignorance: but their horrible prophanation of holy Scripture is much more abominable; as firſt, in depriuing the people of all liberty to read the ſame, as if it were the onely root and ſpring of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. This prohibition was ſo ſtrictly vrged, that it was more danger to bee found reading in a Bible, then forging falſe money, or counterfeiting the Kings coine, and hee was peremptorily iudged an Heretike,<note place="margin">Bereſ. de tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. pag. 44.

But what maruaile if Lay-men were forbidden by Prieſts, when euen Prieſts forbad themſelues to reade the Scripture? For their whole ſtudy was either the Canon Law, or ſome Poſtill, or at leaſt ſome booke of worſe report: as for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they did little acquaint their eyes with that obiect, leaſt it
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:1279:213"/> ſhould induce them into Hereſie. In ſomuch as an old Prieſt hearing a yong man alledge Scripture out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wondred, and ſwore that he had beene a Prieſt fifty yeeres, and yet neuer knew what the New Teſtament was. <hi>Espenſaeus</hi> in his Commentary vpon <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſpenſaeus in Tit. cap. 1. &amp; 2 pag. 105.</note> giueth vs a full iuſtification of this report: for there he thus writeth, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a Noble Italian Biſhop was wont to tell mee, that his Country-men were terrified from the ſtudy of Diuinity vvith feare of being made Heretikes, as if hereſie ſprung from the ſtudy, and not rather from the ignorance of the Scripture.

Without which in their iudgement, the booke of God is an vnperfect rule of faith, a dead letter, an incky diuinity, and no better then a leaden rule, or a noſe of wax, flexible to euery humour. In this ranke I may place diuers counterfeit books, diſguiſed vnder the name of ſome of the Apoſtles, or their Diſciples, full of fables, blaſphemies, and contrarieties, and yet commended to the world as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the written word of God, and beleeued in as holy Scripture it ſelfe. As, the Goſpels of Saint <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> of Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> the booke called <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Orthodoxographa Theologiae ſacroſanctae:</hi> with diuers others. But aboue all, that booke aſcribed to Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> called <hi>Protevangelion, ſiue de natalibus Ieſu Christi, et ipſius Matris virginis Mariae,</hi> beareth the bell for impiety. In this is recorded a long ſtory of Saint <hi>Annes</hi> barrenneſſe, and how by prayer ſhe obtained a childe of God which was the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and how ſhe was dedicated by her Mother to the Lord, and brought vp in the Temple like an holy Nun, and after by lot fell to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and being with childe by the holy Ghoſt, after much trouble and ſtirre, was deliuered in a Caue of her childe, by helpe of a midwife miraculouſly found out by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> with a number more ſuch idle circumſtances, which any Chriſtian heart would bluſh to reade, though they were not aſhamed to write, and commend to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded world as Articles of Faith. There they tell likewiſe of many miracles wrought by our Sauiour Chriſt when he was a childe: as that when he was carried an infant into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and being aſſaulted by theeues, one of the theeues would not ſuffer his fellowes to lay hands vpon <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his company, but departing, deſired the infant Ieſus to remember this good turne: and this was the good theefe whom Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred vpon the Croſſe. Againe, that Chriſt being a Lad, and working with his Father <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the Trade, had beene on a time corrected by him, for miſcutting a peece of timber
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1279:214"/> too ſhort for his worke, had he not miraculouſly with his hands pulled it out to the full length. And thus the doltiſh Friars and Prieſts ſtuffed all their Sermons, diſcourſes, and writings, partly with Legendary tales, and partly with fables out of ſuch <hi>Apocrypha</hi> bookes, leauing in the meane while, the holy Scripture vntouched, wherewith they had ſmall or no acquaintance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides, what doe they by their ſtrange paraphraſes of the text, but turne it into a plaine enterlude or play? The Sermons and Poſtils of their Friars, are ſtuft with ſuch idle ſtuffe, which ſauoureth meerely of a prophane wit, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to no other end, but to the deluding of ignorant people. For inſtance, take the example of that ſinfull woman called <hi>Mary, Luke.</hi> 7. who waſhed our Sauiours feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haires of her-head: this they turne into a pleaſant Comedy, wherein are theſe <hi>Dramata</hi> or Actors. Firſt, <hi>Mary</hi> a wanton Wench, giuen to pleaſure and fleſhly dalliance, like another <hi>Thais:</hi> then her Siſter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> a deuout young woman reprouing her for her wicked life, and perſwading her to repentance: next Ieſus Chriſt, an holy and Religious Preacher working vpon her conſcience by wholeſome and heauenly admonitions. Then <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee preparing a dinner for Chriſt in his houſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining all his Friends that came with him: beſides, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gallant yongſters making loue to <hi>Mary,</hi> and labouring to keepe her in her old courſe of wantonneſſe. And laſtly, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> entertaining her after her conuerſion into her friendſhip and familiarity. There was neuer Comedy better acted, and more to the life, then this Friar-like relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, by that Friar <hi>Menot</hi> by name, which we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe if we read the diſcourſe it ſelfe, as it is written by him at large. In like Comicall manner they handle the perable of the prodigall childe, which being breefely recounted by the Euangeliſt, is ſo enriched and diſguiſed with a number of idle circumſtances, as cannot but moue laughter in reading of them: for the true diſcourſe whereof, as alſo of the ſtory of the Officers that were ſent to apprehend Chriſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7. and

As for their falſe interpretations and miſallegations of texts of Scripture, they are ſo frequent in all their bookes, that it may ſeeme loſt labour to ſtand about them: therfore for a taſte onely take theſe examples following, wherein they apply the Scripture directly intended of our Sauiour Chriſt, to their Saints and Sainteſſes. The booke of the Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> affoordes many examples of this kinde of prophanation, but the concluſion of that booke is worth the noting, which is this, <hi>Multa quidem &amp; alia ſigna fecit Franciſcus, qua non ſunt ſcripta in libro hoc:</hi> ſo affirming the ſame words of him, which were written by the Euangeliſt of Chriſt himſelfe. Thus a Friar of Saint <hi>Dominicks</hi> Order applyed vnto his Patrone Saint <hi>Dominicke</hi> that prophecy of <hi>Zachary,</hi> Chap. 6.1, 2, 3. touching the foure Chariots, which being drawne with foure kinde of Horſes of diuers colours, ſignifie foure kinde of Friars of that Order, <hi>Minors, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Predicants.</hi> To Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> they apply that of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 28.12. <hi>Tis ſignaculum plenitudinis Dei plenus ſapientiae:</hi> and to Saint <hi>Agnes,</hi> that text in the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> 7.6 <hi>Quam pulchra es &amp; decora char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. I Had here caſt Anchor, and ſtroke ſaile, had not two ſhelues lyen in my way, which ſeemed to hinder my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anding: I meane two doubts or ſcruples which are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. The firſt whereof is, How it was poſſible, ſeeing theſe abuſes are ſo palpable, that the world ſhould be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them. And the ſecond, Whether there were none in thoſe blinde times that ſmelt out their deluſions, but all in generall were carried away with the ſtreame thereof: which two things being reſolued, it cannot but be manifeſt, that the Pope is that man of ſinne, that ſonne of perdition, and that great Antichriſt fore prophecied in the Scripture, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that Whore of Babylon which ſhould inebriate the world with her enchaunting cup of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching therefore the firſt: I ſay, that it neede not ſeeme ſtrange, that the world ſhould bee thus deluded by them, if we conſider: firſt, the iuſt iudgement of God, who gaue them vp to the efficacy of deceite, becauſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the loue of the truth, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. For where there is not the loue of the truth, there muſt needes be a loue of lyes, errour and ſuperſtition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if we conſider the powerfull enchauntments of the Babyloniſh Whore, who like a helliſh Sorcereſſe ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world with the vaine name of the Catholike Church, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, and a braue oſtentation of pompous Ceremonies, together with the whole frame of their religion, agreeable to mans corrupt nature, that few (moſt being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with their braue ſhowes) could either conceiue in their heart, or diſcerne with their eyes in what ſtate they ſtood, but were carried in the crowd like ſheepe to the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to manifeſt deſtruction. Thirdly, if we conſider how the word of God, out of which they might drawe ſauing knowledge, and by light whereof might diſcouer their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:1279:219"/> was lockt vp from them in an vnknowne tongue, and not permitted to bee read of any, ſaue ſuch as had a ſpeciall priuiledge and licenſe thereunto: for when light is taken away, darkneſſe muſt of neceſſity follow in place thereof, and the onely light of heauenly truth is to bee found in the holy Scripture as <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. Laſtly, if we conſider the reuerend opinion they had of their holy Mother the Church, and alſo of their Prelates and Prieſts, whoſe doctrines they were forbidden to examine or diſpute, vpon paine of hereſie, but ſwallow al that came to hand, vnder the pretence of an implicite faith, which they were taught was of it ſelfe ſufficient to ſaluation, without any more adoe. From theſe fountaines ſprung all that ſtrange blindneſſe and ſtupidity of thoſe times. For in truth, could any man that was not ſtroken with the ſpirit of giddineſſe and ſlumber, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer frame his heart to beleeue theſe monſtrous doctrines, that Saints departed ought to be worſhipped and inuocated with truſt and confidence as God himſelfe? that the Pope can canonize them to this worſhip at his pleaſure? that Images are to be adored with the ſame degree of honor as is due vnto their patternes, contrary to an expreſſe precept of the Law? that the Pope though neuer ſo wicked a wretch, is as a God vpon earth, cannot ere in his definitions, but hath the keyes of Paradiſe at his girdle, to let in, or ſhut out, whom he liſt? that it is a leſſe ſinne to commit Fornication or Adultery, then for a Prieſt to marry, or for a Lay-man to eate fleſh on a Friday? that euery Maſſe mumbled vp in a corner, and bought with money, can deliuer a ſoule out of Purgatory? that an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Prieſt hauing pronounced certaine Sacramentall words ouer all the loaues in the market, with an intention to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, they ſhould be preſently turned into ſo many Gods? that a man can eate his God; and carry him vp and downe in a box to be adored? that a man can performe workes of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, that is, doe more good workes then are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his owne ſaluation and put the reſt into the treaſury of the Church to be beſtowed vpon others that want? that Emperors and Kings are ſubiects vnto Popes, not onely in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:1279:220"/> Spirituall things, but alſo in Temporall <hi>In ordine ad spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alia?</hi> that it is an heroicall act to kill an hereticall King, namely, ſuch an one as in all things doth not accord with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Laſtly, (to omit many more doctrines of the like nature) that pardon of ſinnes heere in this life, and deliuerance out of Purgatory in the life to come may bee bought for money, and where no money there no remiſſion? I ſay, can any man that is not extreamely ſtupified with ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ignorance beleeue theſe doctrines, which are ſo palpably falſe, and ſo contrary to naturall reaſon, as nothing can bee more? Yea, ſo groſſe was their ſtupidity, that when any thing happened, that might giue them occaſion to miſdoubt they were not right, they were ſo farre from the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, or of laying it to heart, that it reflected vpon them to their further hardning. As when they ſaw the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Bread and Wine to poyſon the receiuers, as the one did an Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the fourth: and the other, the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth: or to be deuoured of Rats and Mice, and dogges, or to putrifie and corrupt in the veſſels wherein they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Theſe occurrents might open their eyes in all wiſe iudgement, but in ſtead thereof it darkened them more, euen to this, to eſteeme thoſe baſe Creatures ſanctified by their greedy theft, and no leſſe then holy Saints in their account. And to ſhut vp the point, were they not vtterly blinded, and depriued of all light of reaſon and vnderſtanding, they would neuer aſcribe ſuch an holy vertue to the very habit of a Friar of the Order of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> that they ſhould thinke if they were wrapped in it at the houre of their death, their ſoules muſt needs flye immediately to heauen: and that the onely meanes for the deuill to be ſaued, was to take vpon him the habit of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> I will not ſpeake of their equalling or rather preferring the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> milke to the blood of Chriſt: there is a whole Poeme of that ſubiect extant, written in Latine by <hi>Clarus Bonarſcius, alias Carolus Scribanius</hi> a Ieſuite: nor of their curing all diſeaſed horſes with holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſprinkled vpon them by a Prieſt on Saint <hi>Loyes</hi> day, at a
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:1279:220"/> Church in <hi>France</hi> dedicated to his honor: nor of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more ſuch like fopperies which might bee produced. This little I thinke enough to cleare the firſt doubt, to wit, that this blindneſſe came vpon the world by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and that it is neither ſtrange nor incredible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching the ſecond obiection, I ſay, that though this blindneſſe was great, yet it was not ſo generall, but there were ſome in the midſt of thoſe darke times which ſpyed out, and diſcouered their abuſes. Witneſſe Saint <hi>Bernard, Petrus Damianus, Guiliemus de ſancto Amore, Nicolau. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus Narbonenſis, Sauanarela</hi> a Florentine, <hi>Arnolphus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orleance, Hildebert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tours, Mathew Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padoua, Vrspergenſis, Clemangis,</hi> with a number more of later time: as <hi>Petrorch, Mantuan, Platina,</hi> not to mention <hi>Iohn Wickleffe, Iohn Huſſe, Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prage, &amp;c.</hi> all which learned perſons did mightily inueigh againſt the abuſes and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe dayes, and that with ſuch vehemency of ſpirit, that the ſound of their words could not but ring in all eares. Take two or three examples in ſtead of all the reſt. <hi>Baronius</hi> bringeth in <hi>Peter Damian</hi> thus crying out againſt the prauities of the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> O the Apoſtolike Sea, <hi>heeretofore the glory of the world, but now alas thou art become the ſhop of Simon, the hammers there beate vpon the Anuile, and their money comes from hell:</hi> whereunto <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelfe addeth theſe words: <hi>for then all fleſh had corrupted their way.</hi>

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1279:221" rendition="simple:additions"/> effect, which he that will may finde in the forequoted place. <hi>Petrarch</hi> alſo, though liuing vnder the Popes noſe, wrote as bitterly againſt the impieties of the Antichriſtian Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue: he called Rome <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſaid, that Chriſt was thence baniſhed, and that Antichriſt ruled in his place: that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was there Iudge, and that vnder the ſtandard of Chriſt they made warre againſt Chriſt: that greater iniury was there done vnto Chriſt, then euer was by the Scribes and Phariſees when he liued amongſt them: that the hope of eternall life was held of them for a fable: that the more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a man was, the more he was prized &amp; honoured. And in a word, that in this Church heauen gate was opened, and Chriſt bought and ſold for Gold, and if <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould bring hither his thirty pence (the price of Chriſts blood) he ſhould be receiued: and that truth was held for folly, and error and lying for the cheefeſt wiſedome. Thus wrote hee, thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, and thus piercingly, and yet (which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) eſcaped the fire, but then the ſacred inquiſition was not on foot, as it is at this day.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:1279:222"/> ſtucke not to ſcoffe at many of their groſſe abſurdities, as he that being reproued for not vncouering his head when hee was ſprinkled with holy water, anſwered; that if that ſacred water could paſſe as farre as Purgatory, it might moſt eaſily paſſe through his Bonnet. Or he that affirmed, that croſſing and holy water might peraduenture ſcarre a way yong deuils that were but young nouices in their trade: but an old deuill would not bee affrighted with ſuch bug-beares. The like ſcoffes were ordinarily caſt out in that blinde Age againſt Purgatory, Inuocation of Saints, and Images, as hath beene ſhewed before. Nay, many of the very Popes themſelues haue made a mocke and ſcoffe of their owne Religon: as <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth called it a Fable, and ſaid; that he could not open the doore of Paradiſe to himſelfe, becauſe he had ſold the keyes thereof vnto others. And <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, that threw Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes into <hi>Tyber,</hi> and tooke in his hand Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Sword; ſaying, that ſeeing Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes could do him no good, he would now try what <hi>Paules</hi> Sword would doe. And <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, <hi>alias Hildebrand,</hi> who when he ſaw the Hoaſt would not anſwere a demand that he made vnto it, in a rage threw it into the fire, in the preſence of many Cardinals that thought to hinder the ſame. And if Popes Holineſſes were thus Atheiſtically prophane, why ſhould we wonder at inferiour Prieſts? As at him that meeting his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the ſtreet, who threatned to beat him but for reuerence to his God of Paſte, laid his God on the ground, ſaying; the deuill take him if hee take part with either of vs. Or at him, that threatned to throw his God into the fire if he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the preſent tempeſt of thunder and lightning, and ſo ſhew himſelfe ſtronger then the deuill: or at him, who hauing receiued a box on the eare by a Captaine, bidding him alſo to turne the other eare to receiue another, according to Chriſts rule, as he alſo did, fell haſtily vpon the Captaine, &amp; buffetted him ſoundly, with this <hi>Memento,</hi> that Chriſt alſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to doe as we would be done vnto; and withall, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſtanders by to let them alone, for they did nothing but expound Scripture: or at him that being about to go to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:1279:222"/> Maſſe, and hauing a box ful of Wafers, ſhooke them together and ſaid, yee rogues, yee rogues, which of you ſhall be made a God to day? Or at him that ſaid, that they dealt with their God in the Maſſe, as a Cat doth with a Mouſe, which after they haue made ſport withall a while, they eare at laſt. But to leaue theſe Prouerbs and ſcoffs, and to come to the verſes that were written in thoſe daies of the impiety and impurity of the Romiſh Cleargy.
